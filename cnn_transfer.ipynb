      "Have you ever thought about how you met your best friend? Was it normal, or was it wacky - like how Elias met Shohei? Pulling a boa constrictor snake named Mathilda out of your backpack can make a remarkable first impression! This book is about three best friends Elias, Honoria, and Shohei, who are united against \"That Which Is The Peshtigo School\". Their goal is to make it through the annual school science fair, but things don't always go as planned.Elias is part of a family made up of science fanatics who would do anything to win a science fair. Elias isn't exactly what you'd call the ambitious type, especially when it comes to science fairs. So he becomes like Galileo and \"retests\" one of his sibling's past projects. Honoria loves to be ambitious, especially when it comes to being a legal counsel extraordinaire. But when she faces a bigger challenge than beating Goliath Reed or getting a piranha to become vegetarian, she doesn't know if she can make it. Shohei is an all around slacker who tries to mooch off Elias instead of creating something on his own. His adoptive parents are constantly encouraging him to start \"hearing\" his ancestors. His mom has even turned Shohei's room into what looks like a walk-in Japanese museum exhibit!This book is laugh out loud hilarious and the more you read, the more exciting and unexpected it gets. I love the title on this book because it really made me laugh and want to read the book. I also like how people so different from one another can be such close friends. There is not much excitement in the beginning, but it builds up very quickly. So if you like that type of story, then this is the book for you.\n",

When playing with two players, the screen splits, which is great, because you don't have to drop out all the time. However, watch changing players or using Jack's compass when the screen is split because it will sometimes freeze up on you. If you like Legos, the other Lego games, or Pirates of the Carribean, then this game is for you. \n",

I needed sturdy stools to deal with heavy use from kids, family, ect. They are 1000% solid. When they arrive you have to screw the seat onto the base swivel mechanism, however all the important parts that make it solid are already in place. You also have to attach the solid wooden seat onto the frame. The seat isn't pre-drilled so that is a bit annoying. Not hard, but annoying. These stools are going to last a very long time, without a doubt. I wouldn't hesitate to buy more. They feel stronger, more solid, and of higher quality than stools I saw for $300 each. I was a little nervous they would look clunky, but they are beautiful with very nice lines. I wish I would have ordered them two months ago when I first saw them.I forgot to mention the box was delivered to my door within two days. Fastest shipping ever. \n",

      "A very interesting take on the end of the Samurai era in Japan.  I just purchased this title earlier today, but so far I am already enthralled with it.  The first things I noticed about the game were: one, its very hard, and two, the story is amazingly open and varied.  On the difficulty end of things, there are very few save points and you only get one life; if you die the game is basically over.  The story plays out like and old samurai movie or Clint Eastwood western (think \"Yojimbo\" or \"Fistful of Dollars\"; you encounter warring factions in a small town and everyone seems to want to recruit you to help tip the balance of power in their favor.  However, the game never pushes you towards a specific direction.  Your character's choices remain refreshingly open ended as the plot develops.  You can fight, switch sides, or just sit back and watch while the npc's fight it out.  The game also has it's quircky Japanese moments, like the afro-haired samurai, and sometimes downright bizzare quips you can choose to taunt your oppents with during battle.  The bigest weak point in the game is definately in the graphics department.  The character faces are genuinly unique and fairly expressive, but the game itself is somewhat jaggy, and definately displays some texture seaming problems.  Another possible quible could come from the intitial dificulty level, which is fairly high.  However, starting from scratch often is not as bad in \"Samurai\" as in some other titles, because it alows the player a chance to view different possible story arcs.  One final not on the music: it's fairly eclectic, I personally enjoy it, but its probably not for everyone.  The rest of the in game sounds are fairly minimal, so if you want to listen to your stereo instead of the game you at least won't be missing anything important. \n",

I really don't think it COULD tear (as some people said) unless you were really stretching it, which isn't necessary. There's very little stretching needed to get it onto the balance board. It was very simple.I do like that it keeps the balance board clean and free from scuffs, but as other posters have said, it does tend to collect hair. Someone commented to one reviewer that they should vacuum more. Well, I vacuum every day but with a 100lb golden retriever, there's hair everywhere all the time even with daily vacuuming, and this cover does tend to collect it. Simple fix is keeping it up off the floor when not in use. It does wipe clean with a damp cloth very easily. Still worth the money, in my opinion.My only gripe is that the little bumps on the surface tend to hurt my feet after long sessions. It does help me find where my feet need to be without looking down, but that's only a minor plus. They should have made the texture a little smaller so as not to hurt sensitive feet. Overall though, recommended if you like to keep your balance board scratch and dirt free. \n",

      "Many reviewers have already covered PHoF's features and gameplay extensively, so I'm just going to talk about a few things I've noticed as a long-time fan of physical and digital pinball.*PHoF has outstanding graphics and sound. Go ahead, compare the digital tables to the real-life machines...pretty much everything, down to the backglass, thumper bumpers, and spinners, is exactly as it should be.*Digital pinball veterans may recall how realisticMicrosoft Pinball Arcadewas, especially given it came out in 1999. PHoF has even better physics, better sound, and a superior selection of machines (I've always dug Williams and Bally more than Gottlieb, even as a kid).*Arabian Nights and Gophers suffer a bit from camera angle problems. The stationary cameras in Gophers are pulled fairly far back, so it's difficult to get a good view of what's going on. Arabian Nights has the opposite problem. The camera angles are too flat, making it difficult to see the upper parts of the playfield. Players who prefer the dynamic cameras, of course, won't be bothered by any of this. In any case, both tables are still fun to play.*The Trophies are pretty easy to earn and seem like a hastily added afterthought to the main game.Bottom line: despite minor camera issues on the more complex tables, PHoF is tons o' fun and well worth picking up. Anybody who loves pinball, especially those who don't have regular access to the real thing, will not be disappointed. \n",

I need prescription lens and my local place admitted they couldn't do it for what Bobster charges (~ $90). I sent them in to SoCa and the fun began. Bobster customer service is an answering machine.

After two months, I got them back the same day I receive a message telling me to mail them back because they had switched mine with another customer's. Back they go the next day and then they e-mail me stating their was no mix up just keep them. Little late, Bobster.Last weekend was cold and windy for our Toys for Tots ride and they functioned very well. Comfortable even with the strap under the helmet; no fogging even with a face mask on.

Looked the part over, removed the broken part and put the new one on and left the existing wiring harness on, saved the new one for future use, all in less than 10 minutes...  I'll tell you, truck parts are a premium but this was gratifying to be able to save money, and having been a DIY'er all my life, being able to do the work yourself (after punishing yourself for the broken tail light)...  Nice!  The part is quality grade and equivalent to the broken part...  I did not inspect the new part under a microscope but the feel and the weight felt like it was going to be alright...

You can put the unit on a desk or tabletop, and it will blow a nice stream of cool air at you.I like the way you can rotate the air head ninety degrees, giving you greater flexibility in positioning the unit.  I also like the little water bottle they give you, which holds two \"recharges\".  Yes, they have figured out how much water you can add to keep cool without water dribbling from the unit.  They figure you can go from thirty minutes to three hours on a \"full\" sponge, depending on your environment.I have told the company that makes the Handy Cooler that they need to introduce a shoulder holster, so you can wear it around and use it hands-free.  In the meantime, I am going to see if I can rig up some sort of shoulder sling or something that will suit this purpose.At any rate, if you hate the heat, the Handy Cooler is the real deal -- cool relief to go.  HIGHLY recommended.My only gripe, as another customer commented, is the high UPS shipping charge.

Also be aware that just because you ARE able to purchase, unpackage, and install an application, that does not mean that you will have the intelligence and perseverance to understand it.Please do note that if you have a love for aviation, if you had a SLIGHTLY above average GPA in school, and you have the patience to read the manual, you will absolutely LOVE this software.  DCS:A-10 Warthog was originally developed for the US Air Force.  They took a few black boxes out and packaged it for civilians.  What this means to you is that you now have the ability to employ, to it's fullest realistic capabilities, one of the most rugged and deadly war machines ever built.  It will take you about 10 minutes to start the aircraft, 30 minutes to get to your target, then dozens of switches and buttons to prepare your weapon..  but I TELL YOU THIS.. when you successfully employ those weapons for the first time, you're experiencing something that only America's best and brightest get to experience: righteous thunder born of highly complex American ingenuity!!This is not a game.. this is a \"Study Simulator\".. that means you must study, then it will simulate(that means like real)a thing.Highly recommended! \n",

Poorly dubbed (\"Ryu, you are so, sen. si. tive!\") and sometimes the scene is cut off before the character can even finish the sentence. (\"How can I decline that invitat...)This game was released for the Sony Playstation 2 around summer of 04, but it did not have online capability like the Xbox version does. As soon as you get the game on Xbox Live, you are required to download something (I am being told that it fixes the rematch bug) as people who imported it earlier were having problems with rematches. Hyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition lets you pick between five character versions of SFII that were released. (Note: this does not include all 5 versions of the actual game, just the characters of those versions). Capcom has yet to fix the dropping issue found in Capcom vs SNK 2 EO, which I will not get into here, but most people already know what it is. I was really hoping they would solve that problem, but evidently not. Add in Street Fighter III: Third Strike and this is an excellent addition to your game collection. \n",

I just happened to see the game version on the loading screen one day and realized that my copy was produced after the original patch was first released.All those days of frustration installing , deleting and reinstalling were unnecessary.In hindsight though I wish I had never figured it out.Getting wasted over and over again by a bunch of prepubescent teens is humiliating beyond belief.Wish I could challenge them to the real thing then we'd really see who gets the prestige,lol. \n",

Not sure what caused it yet but I was exclusively playing this game and last night took the game out of the Xbox to watch a movie. When I reinserted the disc to play that is when I had to start all over.I am having a lot of fun playing this game but at times it is without a doubt the most frustrating game I have ever played. The frustrating part of the game is the cops, they are just too strong too quickly. For example, I am in a LONG race with 4 other racers. During this race we are crashing into each other and setting off shock waves and EMP's to damage the other persons car. So we get done with the race and our cars are pretty beat up. Now the cops arrive and can at times immediately ram your car and disable it which leads to you being busted which then causes you to lose ALL the points you just earned in that race. Without points you can's buy new cars or upgrade your current car. It is VERY frustrating. This is not to say that the game is possible because if you are careful and can get to a repair shop or hideout as soon as you are done racing you can get your points. The problem is that too often this is just not possible. EA needs to badly tune this game so that the cop AI isnt so brutal. I love a challenging game but most of the time the cop AI just gets cheap kills and that just is not fun.On the flip side you can play as the cops. This part of the game is tuned very well and is not frustrating at all. I personally do not enjoy playing as a cop as much as a racer but it does add a lot of replay value to the game.So I give this game 3.5 stars because there are a lot of positives.Pros:-Gorgeous graphics: weather and particle effects. Full day/night cycle.-Smooth frame rate-Large world with diverse scenery-Sounds are amazing-Controls are tightCons:-Cop AI is just too ruthlessI havent seen any bugs that some of the other reviewers are mentioning. I did just get the game for Christmas and there was a 350MB patch when I first installed it so that may have squashed them. \n",

The paint being reviewed here is the \"Gloss\" celery.  These two cans I used were used to repaint some old wicker chairs and two metal lawn chairs.  The wicker was no problem what so ever.  The paint went on smooth and evenly and was not overly thick or too thin.  The metal chairs of course needed quite a bit of prep work but it paid off and this paint did the job I pain for it to do.One can of this stuff will go a long, long way and two cans were more than adequate to finish the job.I have used Krylon before on outdoor and indeed, indoor projects.  It is very durable, goes on smooth and I have no complaints.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks \n",

I was still using it in 2010 when my husband purchased a new Model 930 All American for me as a Christmas gift. I think that says something for durability and quality! The new 930 has fulfilled every expectation and more.  There are several things that put the All-American above the competition. It has both a weighted gauge and a dial gauge.  The six screw down knobs keep the lid secure, no question. There is, of course, a safety valve in the lid and one look at the quality construction shows that this purchase will last longer than a lifetime. There is no gasket needed so there is no hassle trying to find the correct replacement. Make sure to follow the first time instructions on greasing the lip where the lid and canner come together. While the initial cost of an All-American canner is higher than other pressure canners, in the long term it probably ends up costing less because of it's durability. I still occasionally use that 65+ year old AA canner when canning season is in full swing and it still takes high honors with me. \n",

You should know before you buy this that there are no challenges, no way to include songs from older games or buy new songs on the playstation store, and do not count on party play at all, because it basically doesn't exist.  all of that aside, you still get all of the songs from the ps3 version, which i think is 85.  the graphics are still awesome for ps2 and all of the character movements and looks have been improved.  one thing that you may or may not like is that if you've seen the way the notes and the highway look on ps3, they are not like that one this one, they look more the way guitar hero 3 or world tour was.  also, people had complained about loading times, but i don't notice much difference between this and the ps3 version.  overall, still an awesome game and as long as you can sacrifice a few features that are not necessary to enjoy the game, you should like it. \n",

It is a good size (and I have big hands) and the side buttons are not easily activated on accident, an issue I've had with side button mice in the past.  The software driver allows for editing just about every aspect of it's performance from button reassignment to macro assignment.  These are probably pretty standard features for a gaming mouse like this.The mousepad, however, is where the magic is.  The mouse really does leave a noticable light trail on it.  The movement across the pad is about as frictionless as a mouse can be.  You need to be in a pretty dark environment to notice the light trail, but if you let it sit on one spot for more than 5 seconds, it will leave a clearly visible mark on the pad.  I do not think I've ever seen any sort of product like this before.  Very original.I am a Mac user, and there is no driver support for Mac yet.  This is the only reason I am giving this product 4 instead of 5 stars.  I actually prefer it being corded, but there is no excuse to not offer Mac support.

      "Note to others: these are NOT fluffy, ringspun terrycloth towels. I saw some reviews that seemed disappointed by this fact- I'm guessing these people did not read the description. These are old fashioned 'bar-keep' type towels. They are plenty absorbent if you wash them correctly per the instructions provided with the towels. The point of these towels is that they are LINT FREE, so they are great for drying glasses and dishes, and cleaning glass etc in your house. Because of their thinner material, they dry a lot faster than a traditional terrycloth towel. This is helpful in the kitchen, where musty/moldy odors are known to accumulate. Don't use fabric softener on these (or any) towels to try to make them softer- that kills their absorbency. \n",

However, the chain holding the spoons together is another matter.  It is way too thin.  When using the spoons, the chain opens up and the spoons fall out all over the counter. It is truly irritating.  The company needs to improve this. \n",

      "At the official D23 Disney fan convention this game was heavily promoted, but surprisingly this game is not for Disney fans. The game questions are incredibly easy and often the answers can be found in the picture on the back of the card. The gameplay is also too simple. In traditional versions of Trivial pursuit players must travel around the board to answer questions from six different categories. I would expect to see categories about Theme Parks, Movies, Animation, Television, Marvel, but instead there are only three categories. The categories are trivia, lists, and a category where you answer questions about your teammate. The major flaw in the gameplay is that you do not need to collect wedges from each category. Instead you can pick whatever category you would like. The game questions are incredibly juvenile and this is not very enjoyable for Disney fans.Instead of getting this I recommend these two Disney trivia games:Wonderful World of Disney Trivia Game in Collectible TinorThe Wonderful World of Disney Trivia 2: The Sequel Game \n",

      "We ordered this because it's a very cool concept and we love wooden toys. At these criteria, it's a winner. However:1) It came in the wrong color, which appears to be a theme with this product, considering that the only other reviewer says the same thing.2) The assembly is fairly brutal, and there's a step in which a rectangle of 3/16-inch luan is supposed to bent/curved to an incredible degree and then, while held in this impossible position, slid into very specific grooves. Naturally, the piece of wood snapped in half while my wife and I were on that step. We went to the hardware store and cut an identically sized piece of much more flexible plexiglass to replace the part.In the end we were able to get it functioning, but it required our own supplies, a tolerance for the wrong color, and a great deal of patience. \n",

      "I received this as a gift from a friend for Christmas 2012. We are both fans of the show and he knew I loved writing. Seems like this was a perfect match. Until I tried to use it.When I first looked at it, I thought it looked a bit cheap but I would give it a shot. After a year of trying to write in it, I'm almost at the point of giving up and just telling my friend I've misplaced it.Most people on here are complaining about the look of the book. My complaint is the paper. It is as if someone just took office copy paper and just printed out the same brown image a few hundred times to put in this book. Because of this, it does not want to take ink. Its fine if all you use is a ballpoint pen to write with. If you want to use any sort of different pen (Gel, Rollerball, Fountain, etc) then you should just skip this journal. The ink just can't soak into the pages. My letters have this light, choppy appearance that just makes everything look bad. The best thing to write in this book is a Sharpie.If you are a fan of Doctor Who and don't take writing as seriously as myself, then this is an OK buy. The comments about the overall look and feel from other people still apply. \n",

      "My baby girl loves playing with my husbands ipad and is constantly intrigued about songs, games, zoo animals etc.. apps available that we have downloaded for free from apple.  Long story short we felt necessary to buy a tablet for her that she could continue learning and having fun with as well as be able to kick around drop and put her sticky Little fingers all over.  The Leappad is great for young kids that will only stick to leap pad apps and for parents that want to continue buying games and learning apps that cost anywhere from 5-45 dollars in most cases the best apps seem to be 25 dollars. You ncant even get into u-tube or put music on it that we have already downloaded from amazon (baby lullaby) The 5 dollar apps were very few and nothing interesting for my daughter.  I was also discourage because there where no baby sign language apps or zoo animal apps to download.  We returned it and will invest in a tablet for her that we can download videos from u-tube that are free.  On an occasion we will pay for an app but the most i would want to pay is 10 dollars but average no more then 5 dollars.  The other advice i can give buy a cheaper tablet like the Nabi JR and buy the protected case for it. \n",

      "I was unhappy with all the cheap doctor sets out there, and my 3 year old son was unimpressed by them. I have a lot of health issues, and have been hospitalized multiple times, so playing doctor is one of the ways my son deals with his anxieties and fears about it all. Its really given him a sense of empowerment to understand what hospitals are for and what doctors really do. So this Christmas I decided to make him a QUALITY doctor set, something that would help him learn and expand as opposed to a bunch of plastic dodads that would just take up space in the play area.This stethoscope was the absolute icing on the cake for his set. He use to pretend to listen to peoples heart with the pretend plastic one that came with his doctor costume, but now he can ACTUALLY listen to heartbeats thanks to this. He listens to EVERYONE that will let him (especially enjoys listening to mama's belly since baby brother is in there and due very soon.) Its worth every cent. \n",

      "Before i get into this review, i'd like to give props to Amazon for the awesome shipping, as my Xbox One arrived a day early and in perfect condition. With that being said, i'd also like to point out that i have been more of a Sony guy who HATED the 360 myself, but the PS4 somewhat disappoint me a little bit, so i thought i would give Microsoft another chance, and so far, i am not regretting my decision. I hated everything about the Xbox 360. The controller, the unreliability of it (I went through 2 Xboxs due to malfunctions out of my hands), and decided i would never buy another 360 again. When the Xbox One was announced, i honestly laughed at it with the ridiculous DRM policies and whatnot. But when i got my PS4 and found that it really wasn't cutting it that well, i thought i would give the One a chance, seeing as how my girlfriend has one and it seemed promising.The first thing i noticed about the Xbox One is the EXCELLENT controller it has. It's got to be one of the best controllers iv'e ever used, it just feels next-gen. The next thing i noticed about the system that kind of surprised me was the Kinect. I was one of the guys who thought they would never touch it, but it actually is a nifty little device. It's pretty cool being able to turn on the Xbox with the sound of your voice. When it works, it's cool, when it doesn't, you look like a tool yelling at your TV. I still would have liked to not have had to spend an extra $100 because of the Kinect, but at least it is somewhat useful. For the sake of keeping this relatively short, here is a list of my main pros and cons on the system so far;PROS:+ Amazing controller+ Kinect is somewhat useful, and much better than the previous one+ Crisp looking graphics+ The ability to multi-task is great+ More customization options+ PLENTY of Apps+ Comes with a headset (Albeit cheap, but still a headset.)CONS:- Games have taken FOREVER to install ( This is the main problem i have with the console so far; Forza 5 took over an hour to fully install)- Pricey Gold memberships ($10 a month, really?)- The other forms of entertainment seem to exceed the gaming part of the console- Games crash fairly often (You will be playing a game, and randomly it goes black and your sent to the Dashboard).Overall, if you want to focus on purely gaming, you're better off with a PS4, but if you want a little bit of everything, this is the console for you. I definitely am enjoying this bad boy so far, and i am hoping for good thing from it.EDIT: So after almost two weeks of using my Xbox One, i have experienced a bit of a problem. There have been a few times where i have been playing a game online (most notably Forza 5 and COD Ghosts), and i will get randomly kicked of the game onto the dashboard. I have no clue why it happens, but it's relatively frustrating when you are doing well, and are randomly sent to the dashboard out of absolutely nowhere. This is the only bug that i have come across so for, but aside from that i am still enjoying the console very much.EDIT x2: It is now June 2014 and Microsoft is now offering a Kinect-less Xbox One. Get it if your considering buying a Xbox One. The kinect isn't bad, but after 6+ months of using it, it is absolutely not worth an extra $100, unless your idea of $100 well-spent is having the ability to say \"Xbox, on\". \n",

      "I give Power A props for trying to improve on the antiquated design of the Sony controller.  However, the poor right stick placement and huge dead zone just negate the point of the redesign.I absolutely loath the Playstation controller's analog stick placement.  So when I saw this controller, which looked like a replica of the 360's, I was thrilled.  It has a really solid feel and the grip is a nice touch.  The left stick is exactly where it should be.  However, the right stick is still too far of a reach.  My right thumb felt very awkward the whole time and I simply could not get into the FPS groove like I can on the 360.  And to make it worse, those who mentioned the huge dead zone where spot on!  I was able to move the sticks almost a quarter-inch without a response.  Finally, the problem that sealed the return was the fact that the transceiver simply stopped working after about 30 minutes of play.I do not recommend this controller for those looking to replicate 360 experience on the PS3.Pros: Great, solid feel. Left thumb stick is right where it should be.Cons: VERY uncomfortable right thumb stick placement. HUGE analog stick dead zone. \n",

      "This game has been in development for quite a while, and in some parts it shows and in other parts it looks like the game was put together in a week.  Based on today's standards there wasn't really a lot that drew me in.  The graphics are nothing the ps2 couldn't muster, and the music pales to the 16-bit iterations.  The player models look really funny.  Backgrounds are really still and boring, and no walls are used.  A lot of the background themes do not relate at all to the series.  Didn't mortal kombat 3 have crumbling stages?  The sound effects are not mixed well enough together, but are passable.  Player chatter is extremely weak, compared to other titles in similar genres.  Speaking of fighters, if you ever play games like virtua fighter 4, tekken 3, and soul calibur this just doesn't live up to that, so that may be in your head.  also, the animation is not a pretty sight to behold.  The special moves are horrible, again the 16-bit versions upstage DA in this category.  And where are the stables like sheng tsung's morph, scorpion's teleport, and others??  Also, the controls are not responsive to what you press until over a half-second.  Gameplay is not balanced at all, the weapons are too strong. Performing moves overall seems sporatic.  I also will say the story [stinks], endings [stinks], and game modes [sucks].  Konquest sounds cool, but all it is is just a repetitive training level...zzz..zz.  And it floors me that midway omitted stage fatalities, something in mortal kombat ONE, and then decided to go with 1 fatality per person.  They were wasting time trying to mimic other fighters mode's instead, instead the could of had hundred's of fatalities on the xbox's hardrive.  Overall Mortal Kombat deadly allience isn't worth the money, anything noteworthy it does another fighter on the market does much better. \n",

      "The 360 wireless controller is one nice piece of hardware.  I own a video game store and i know a thing about them.  some of the reviews ive read here gave it a low score for a couple reasons.  one when you get a new wireless controller you need to sync with your system for it to work.  Push the tiny button on the top of the unit and the button on the front of the 360 at close to the same time.  then it will sync and work properly. the second thing people seem to complain about is how many batteries they go through.  like any modern electronic device that uses batteries cheap \"store brand\" batteries will die very very fast, like in a few days time inside one of these controllers.  I would strongly suggest getting batteries that are made for use in demanding electronic devices and they generally will say so right on the package.  I play my 360 ALOT and usually a good set of batteries will last me 2 - 3 weeks.  hope this helps \n",

When my freind got the game I was admittedly a little dissapointed,but two months later a kid at school said it was great. The next day at my friends house I forced myself to play past the first day. The more I played the more I loved it. Infact my freind (who hadn't played the game since she got it) pushed me aside and started playing. Needless to say the next day I got the game. I'm hooked now. The festivles aren't very good but besides thatit's the best. and because things change every year it doesn't become too repetitive which was my one problem with 64. It also has beatiful graghics, like for instance the cows look real! Your son is really cute too! So I definatley recomend this game. It brings harvest moon to a whole new level. \n",

      "A very interesting take on the end of the Samurai era in Japan.  I just purchased this title earlier today, but so far I am already enthralled with it.  The first things I noticed about the game were: one, its very hard, and two, the story is amazingly open and varied.  On the difficulty end of things, there are very few save points and you only get one life; if you die the game is basically over.  The story plays out like and old samurai movie or Clint Eastwood western (think \"Yojimbo\" or \"Fistful of Dollars\"; you encounter warring factions in a small town and everyone seems to want to recruit you to help tip the balance of power in their favor.  However, the game never pushes you towards a specific direction.  Your character's choices remain refreshingly open ended as the plot develops.  You can fight, switch sides, or just sit back and watch while the npc's fight it out.  The game also has it's quircky Japanese moments, like the afro-haired samurai, and sometimes downright bizzare quips you can choose to taunt your oppents with during battle.  The bigest weak point in the game is definately in the graphics department.  The character faces are genuinly unique and fairly expressive, but the game itself is somewhat jaggy, and definately displays some texture seaming problems.  Another possible quible could come from the intitial dificulty level, which is fairly high.  However, starting from scratch often is not as bad in \"Samurai\" as in some other titles, because it alows the player a chance to view different possible story arcs.  One final not on the music: it's fairly eclectic, I personally enjoy it, but its probably not for everyone.  The rest of the in game sounds are fairly minimal, so if you want to listen to your stereo instead of the game you at least won't be missing anything important. \n",

      "If you want a innovative baseball expierence, then you must get MVP Baseball 2004. Ever since EA Sports changed Triple Play to MVP Baseball in 2003, it has been one of the top sellers in the baseball category.First off, MVP Baseball's hitting feature is 5 stars. It's like the right thumbstick is a bat. If you point the stick up, you will hit either a pop fly or if you have someone like Vladimir Guerrero, you will hit a homerun. If you point the stick down, you will hit a grounder.Pitching is also genius. You have the pitching meter, so if you choose to have a power up pitch, your pointer on the meter will go into the red zone. The harder the pitch, the harder it is to get into the green zone, which is accuracy. So if you need to be accurate, you may want to take some off your pitch.Graphics are the best in any MLB game. `Nuff said.But in a great game there is always bad stuff. I was pitching mike stanton for the Mets with 24 stamina and it was very simple to put your pitches anywhere. Once you get the hang of the pitching meter, it is very easy to throw difficult pitches. Also, if a fast runner, or even medium speed runner, hits a gapper, he will get an easy triple and even maybe an inside the park homerun. It always seems your chasing those long fly balls.But aside from that, the amount of extras are impeccable. There are retro jerseysfrom every team and 50 old school players. They have players like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jackie Robinson. Clearly, MVP Baseball is the best MLB game of our time, period! \n",

      "Many reviewers have already covered PHoF's features and gameplay extensively, so I'm just going to talk about a few things I've noticed as a long-time fan of physical and digital pinball.*PHoF has outstanding graphics and sound. Go ahead, compare the digital tables to the real-life machines...pretty much everything, down to the backglass, thumper bumpers, and spinners, is exactly as it should be.*Digital pinball veterans may recall how realisticMicrosoft Pinball Arcadewas, especially given it came out in 1999. PHoF has even better physics, better sound, and a superior selection of machines (I've always dug Williams and Bally more than Gottlieb, even as a kid).*Arabian Nights and Gophers suffer a bit from camera angle problems. The stationary cameras in Gophers are pulled fairly far back, so it's difficult to get a good view of what's going on. Arabian Nights has the opposite problem. The camera angles are too flat, making it difficult to see the upper parts of the playfield. Players who prefer the dynamic cameras, of course, won't be bothered by any of this. In any case, both tables are still fun to play.*The Trophies are pretty easy to earn and seem like a hastily added afterthought to the main game.Bottom line: despite minor camera issues on the more complex tables, PHoF is tons o' fun and well worth picking up. Anybody who loves pinball, especially those who don't have regular access to the real thing, will not be disappointed. \n",

      "The long review:3D Dot Game Heroes is a very unique game, graphically more than anything. It has that old school 8-bit game feel, only using voxels instead of pixels in an isometric 3D world. The music's tip-of-the-hat to NES/SNES-esque soundtracks brings back waves and waves of nostalgia. The feel of the game itself is almost identical to the first Legend of Zelda (overworld exploration, dungeon crawling, combat system, weapons/items), but that isn't a bad thing at all.  It shows how a classic can be relived through modern means. The game also features a gigantic set of characters to choose from, recently some of which are fan-made, and all of which serve their own purpose of aesthetics and of unique stat bonuses, such as +1 to Strength or +1 to Magic. You also have the option of creating your own characters from the ground up. I also liked how you could change your character whenever you wanted, although accomplishing this task involved saving and exiting to the main menu.Pros:-Incredible soundtrack, with catchy music you will find yourself humming-Sense of humor (dialogue, some weapons/items and games)-Character selection and creator is the game's pride and joy, sets it apart from others-Reasonable upgrade/equipment acquisition-Entertaining minigames-Fun campaign, although...Cons:-The campaign is also slightly repetitive, unless you know where to look for side quests (you won't, unless you look online or by a stroke of luck find and complete one yourself)-You have to have a good memory. No quest log, map doesn't update as it does in other games (i.e. the temple you just finished is still marked as your \"destination\" although you have to \"turn in\" its completion somewhere else)-You will notice that at full health, you gain the benefit of having an over-sized sword. This is generally great to have, although if the smallest obstacle is in the way (such as a tree stump or ledge) your sword will stop in its tracks, making combat a little bit of a pain sometimes. This also applies to the \"dash\" skill you acquire in the game, as your sword bounces you back if you hit something, possibly making you shift screens again, which is very annoying.Bottom line:3D Dot Game Heroes is a fun adventure game, as there is plenty to explore and fun dungeons to go through. Lots of work was put into this game. It is definitely worth the price. \n",

      "Couldn't live without a Cruise Control in my 1997 Toyota Corolla which I just bought! Rostra offered left and right column mount controls as well as dash mount units. I would definitely suggest the column mount. I picked the right side mounted unit as I only had the windshield washer stalk on that side. Left side already had the stalks for the lights and wheel tilt and I thought it might be a little crowded. Turns out after installing it that it easily would have fit on the left (different part number). Depending on your preference or experience with other vehicles, either side would have worked fine. Dropping off the bottom of the steering column was easy on my vehicle and then it was simple to drill the hole to mount it through. You will want to be certain that you check for clearance on the column itself for the stub of the stalk and the wiring. You will also want to be sure that if your other column mounted items move, that they don't move into the location of the new cruise control switch. Otherwise, after finding a good location for installing it and then the hook-up to the actual cruise control unit was a breeze with just a simple pig tail to plug in. The &#34;touch&#34; to set the controls on this control switch is very &#34;soft.&#34; I sometimes brush by it when tuning the radio and disengage it. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 star is because this comes with a green LED light on it and it is so pale that during daylight hours it is next to impossible to tell if it is on or not. This really should be improved. I spend time looking away from the road and attempting to shield around the light to see if it is indeed on or not. There's no good reason for this to not be a more readily visible light. It shows fine after it is rather dark. After about 2000 miles of mixed driving I'm happy with the unit. \n",

Maybe.After several hoops and delays on their end, they were &#34;rushed&#34; ordered to their eye guys. After two months, I got them back the same day I receive a message telling me to mail them back because they had switched mine with another customer's. Back they go the next day and then they e-mail me stating their was no mix up just keep them. Little late, Bobster.Last weekend was cold and windy for our Toys for Tots ride and they functioned very well. Comfortable even with the strap under the helmet; no fogging even with a face mask on. I would buy them again and recommend them to a friend.Good product, but poor to confusing customer service at Bobster. \n",

Looked the part over, removed the broken part and put the new one on and left the existing wiring harness on, saved the new one for future use, all in less than 10 minutes...  I'll tell you, truck parts are a premium but this was gratifying to be able to save money, and having been a DIY'er all my life, being able to do the work yourself (after punishing yourself for the broken tail light)...  Nice!  The part is quality grade and equivalent to the broken part...  I did not inspect the new part under a microscope but the feel and the weight felt like it was going to be alright...

      "My title says it all. After having read reviews i was totally hyped up about it, but after receiving it and using it for the first time it stopped working on me. The power would shut off after turning it on for 15-30 sec. When i called customer service from Hoover they told me it's a built in manufacturer default if your bag is full, but my question is \"How can it be full after first use?\" dumbfounded? I know, i was too. Then after 30 min on the phone with rep they said to drop it off at Sears (Hoover's service center). So here's where the story gets even better... After dropping it off i was told it would take 4-6wks. And i was ok with that. Then 6 wks. goes by so the logical thing i thought was to call Hoover, i left 2 or 3 messages... and i hear nothing back regarding the status of my vacuum still. Finally, Sears calls me to bill me $400 some ridiculous amount for the service repair (which i was told was under warranty for the manufacturer repair). Ummm, hello?!!! I shouldn't have to spend over $200 for my new vacuum and it have a defect after first use AND pay $400 for the repair!! Anyone with me here on this? I could buy 2 more sets of hoover's defective 'Platinum' vacuum at that price!!!! And have a 50/50 chance that one isn't going to quit on me after first use! So once again, i have to call hoover rep back (again having to leave a message) and i finally get a call back 8 wks into this whole drama from a hoover rep and now i'm told it will be another 2-3 wks before it gets done. \"Seriously?\" Let's think through this logically after knowing this whole scenario: if its defective after first use, they should have just sent me a new one!1) i paid for a new vacuum, and had i known the customer service was going to be like this and the vacuum that had such great reviews was going to break after first use, i would have been better off buying a REFURBISHED vacuum (which is pretty much what i ended up with)2) it obviously cost money (apparently over $400) for repairs, so why not just replace mine?!!!3) if they would have replaced mine, it probably would have been expedited a lot faster than the 9 wks i had to wait for my vacuum to be repairedSo in conclusion, shouldn't hoover have thought \"Hmmm, let's keep our customer happy and just replace the vacuum?\"Yeah, you would think. If i could, i would give this product and the poor hoover customer service a big fat ZERO on review. \n",

      "Yes, this little puppy really does work as advertised.  Just wet the sponge, turn the unit on, and point the air stream at your face.Ahhhhhh...The Handy Cooler appears to be well built.  The fan is very quiet.  You can put the unit on a desk or tabletop, and it will blow a nice stream of cool air at you.I like the way you can rotate the air head ninety degrees, giving you greater flexibility in positioning the unit.  I also like the little water bottle they give you, which holds two \"recharges\".  Yes, they have figured out how much water you can add to keep cool without water dribbling from the unit.  They figure you can go from thirty minutes to three hours on a \"full\" sponge, depending on your environment.I have told the company that makes the Handy Cooler that they need to introduce a shoulder holster, so you can wear it around and use it hands-free.  In the meantime, I am going to see if I can rig up some sort of shoulder sling or something that will suit this purpose.At any rate, if you hate the heat, the Handy Cooler is the real deal -- cool relief to go.  HIGHLY recommended.My only gripe, as another customer commented, is the high UPS shipping charge.  A lower-cost USPS shipping option would be welcome...And yes, I use NiMH rechargeable batteries, and they last for hours on a charge.  Ahhhh... \n",

      "Unlike the supposed success of the original review of this toy, we did not have such luck. Two parents attempted to put it together and after hours of trying to get it to work (crawl hand over hand across a string), it would not work. It is not designed well at all. The weight of the monkey pulls it to the side and the \"hand\" does not connect with the string. The hands seem to be at an incorrect angle for them to be in the right position to catch the string. It would not work going forward or backward.  We double checked all of the steps and are sure we had it built right. Maybe we will have more luck with some of the other designs.As for durability, if it missed the string and fell to the ground, it fell all to pieces.The cover is also misleading - saying you can make 17 different things with it. I'm sure you can, but they only give you 6 plans, not 17. These lego things are so complicated that unless you have the detailed designs, I don't see how they expect you to be able to make those other 11 items, especially if you are only an 8 yr old.Our son was so disappointed that it would not climb the string. That was a shame since it took a couple of hours to put it together and then nothing. \n",

      "Our kids have several Melissa and Doug toys. They are mostly simple puzzles or cook sets until this garage which has many parts and has to be put together. There are a couple of major issues.  First, the wooden ramps were supposed to be interchangeable and the same size. Ours had up to a quarter inch difference meaning they didn't assemble well including the cars not rolling down them as prescribed. I had to force them.However, that's not the worst part. The ramps are joined to the main structure by cheap plastic. The wood and plastic is joined by tiny screws. During assembly those screws popped out several times. This was due to the poor construction cited above but also the fact that metal screws and cheap plastic are not a good combo. The plastic strips easily. This is dangerous as a child could easily ingest the screws. Do not buy this product and it should be taken off the market. \n",

      "Purchased this over Christmas at a cheap price and that is exactly what I received... cheap cheap cheap.  The old adage of \"you get what you pay for\" is very true in this scenario.  Most of the mini flags wouldn't stand up and the track kept on collapsing.  The only redeeming factor for this \"toy\" is the little car with the \"twist-tie\" ability.  That is all!!  My 3 year old son busted the car within 30 minutes so that too didn't stand up to the 9.99 that I shelled out for this toy.  It's premise and idea are a lot of fun but the quality and ability just never came into fruition.Do not recommend even for the vehicle.  Hot wheels have stood up through time; these \"cars\" will not.  If you find it very cheap then try it out for yourself but please do not purchase this set as a gift for any children outside of your home.  You will be very humiliated after they attempt to put this contraption together. \n",

The motor is too weak to pump the water effectively and is extremely prone to breaking down.  The blades get clogged easily, and the device is quite difficult to take apart and clean.  The push-button switch tends to get stuck, and when I took it apart to try to fix it, the mechanism broke down.  I am a physics major and my father-in-law an engineer, so we are both mechanically minded: we cannot believe how poorly this product is designed.  The pump is not durable enough for a small child (bought for a 2 1/2 year old) to use on a regular basis.  Again, great concept here, but plagued with serious design flaws.

Not the point but it was the reason I returned the 12\" bear.  However, that bear was soooooooo soft and squishy, I decided to rethink the purchase and ordered the 29\" this time for Santa to deliver on Christmas morning.  It was my son's first Christmas and, as he seems to like plush toys right now, I wanted him to have a bear bigger than him.  Given the price, I thought, \"You fool.\"  And then I hit the order button.  Let me say, when my son sees this bear in his room, he goes straight to it.  He lays on it.  He rolls around with it.  He hugs it and squeezes it.  He falls asleep on it. It eclipses every other plush toy he has and it is, without exception, his favorite.  I could not be more thrilled!  It makes me smile every time I see him with it and I know, this was the best money spent, by far.  So happy I bought it.  I would buy it 1000 times over.  Love the product and love the company.

      "I give Power A props for trying to improve on the antiquated design of the Sony controller.  However, the poor right stick placement and huge dead zone just negate the point of the redesign.I absolutely loath the Playstation controller's analog stick placement.  So when I saw this controller, which looked like a replica of the 360's, I was thrilled.  It has a really solid feel and the grip is a nice touch.  The left stick is exactly where it should be.  However, the right stick is still too far of a reach.  My right thumb felt very awkward the whole time and I simply could not get into the FPS groove like I can on the 360.  And to make it worse, those who mentioned the huge dead zone where spot on!  I was able to move the sticks almost a quarter-inch without a response.  Finally, the problem that sealed the return was the fact that the transceiver simply stopped working after about 30 minutes of play.I do not recommend this controller for those looking to replicate 360 experience on the PS3.Pros: Great, solid feel. Left thumb stick is right where it should be.Cons: VERY uncomfortable right thumb stick placement. HUGE analog stick dead zone. \n",

      "This review is most certainly going to warrant the \"un-helpful\" from the most avid, politically-correct reviewers, as they will most certainly see that this is not a review of Far Cry, and I of all people do not especially enjoy spotting those reviewers who have never even touched the games in which they are so unhappily ranting, however; the games today are asking for an all-out lawsuit in blatant misrepresentation.  Fortunately for them, the least they will get are our reviews bringing the magic tricks into the light.It seems as if the game developers, in amidst a chaos of illegal downloading and cd copying have sent a huge unnoticed cluster bomb in the way of those who are actually supporting their economic ventures - and is the unavailability to play their games the thanks we get?  Absolutely.I am very disappointed in the games that have been released throughout the last few years - not for the lack of creativity or poor design - but for the lack of a better guide for those who actually care about the quick buck of our beloved game makers.  Remember that silly little NVIDIA-tag commercial that jumps into action right before you enter the game?  It has that cheesy motto spread like butter right over the monitor screen:  It says, \"The way it's meant to be played.\"  As much as I don't appreciate the trendiness this  motto implies as a lackluster commercial for the games we have already bought into - it does make an interesting point referring to games in general - This F@&$in' game is actually meant to be PLAYED!?  Shocking, is it not?  Who would have thought?Well, apparently not to the millions of people who bought into the game only to realize the game makers have withheld crucial information and they have thwarted the very people who they are attempting to sell the game to.What in sin am I talking about?  Misrepresentation.You don't sell an electric saw that malfunctions in a basic electric outlet without warning the audience in bright bold letters, do you not?  You will be sued for negligence.Far Cry must be the exception in the eyes of the publishers/game makers.  For instance, Far Cry will not work on CDR/CDRW/DVDR/DVDRW at all.  This is a far crying shame, not because I can't play the game, but because I should have been warned before I tipped my dollar hand.  Why can't we have a nice big sparkly label on the front of the box which clearly states that we can't play the game if we have the basic outlets?!Game developers are starting to get the hang of not letting us in on their dirty little secrets - so they can make bank, and we get nothing in return except for a couple discs that will not install.  And I know these are good games, but we must be warned about deviations for the basic hardware that our computers have, right?Far cry is far from being the only one on this train wreck.  Myst IV, has the same problem as Far cry, but for the DVD re-writable drives.  I didn't run into THAT problem, but certainly there was no specific label that could be found.  Is this the way we are supposed to treat our consumers?Thief 3 and Deus Ex: Invisible War will not run on computers with the NVIDIA Graphics card.  This is not an average problem that many will commonly run into due to the fact most people have a NVIDIA graphics card.  These games don't need to include the NVIDIA cards, but they certainly need to include their audience in this decision - right?  I want to see the nice gold label on the front of the box that says \"Won't work with NVIDIA Cards.\"  Save us the trouble, right?!And then Half-life 2.  The only single player game to come out with the required use of an internet nearest you.  Yes, I see that ten font sentence on the bottom of the box now - but wouldn't it have been that much easier to warn everyone in advance?  Even the magazine gamers that have played this game didn't happen to mention this - I expected much better.  How the hell did they even play the game without noticing this?  Unless, the publishers didn't mention that to them - but that's doubtful.  Well, I've canceled my PC Gamer subscription - Amazon reviewers aren't as likely to pass up such details; we don't get paid for playing games or paid if our games do not work properly.  Sure, they'll get away with it -because this information was included at the bottom of the box, but surely there was someone up in the big office warning everyone not to let this fart out into the open - and they should be ashamed.These sloppy misrepresentations have alienated me as a gamer - and I for one will NOT buy a recently released game until I have looked into at least fifty of the reviews - because it is obvious the developers will continue to use this \"Don't tell\" policy.  I suggest you consider doing the same thing - because refunds are hard to come by in the gaming world.  Enjoy Far Cry - I have yet to play it. \n",

      "I am a big World Cup fan. The thrill of your country or any other country I'm rooting for, seeing them play is just awesome.So here this game came out yesterday and it feels like I'm playing the same game that I played in 2010. Now this can be good and bad. To me it left a bad taste in my mouth.World Cup 2010 was an awesome game at the time. Everything was pretty much perfect.Hearing about World Cup 2014 as how it was going to be made to the limits of xbox 360, made me excited again to get this game.After playing this version though, it looks like they reached the xbox 360 limits in 2010. The game does not bring anything significant to the table to make it worth getting.Now if you have never played any previous World Cup games or skipped the 2010, I think this will be the game for you, as you will get to learn how to play the game with mini skill challenges that the game offers, which is kind of nice.So let me put this in a pro and cons list.Pro:-Up to date team members of each national team.-Great same gameplay as 2010-Has mini games(skill challenges/training). Great for beginners and skilled alike.-Now you can listen to commentaries from 2 radio world cup shows, or play EA sound track instead during training or while at the menu list before your next match. (Kind of cool.)Cons:-While FIFA 14 was available on all platforms, this one is not. (Xbox One version would have been great and should have been made)-Graphics are the same and possibly (not noticeable) slightly worse than 2010 version.-Road to Rio, does not work as the servers seem to be screwed up.-Servers seem to not be able to connect to players on launch day. (You don't always get what you pay for)-Commentaries have pretty much not changed at all during game. Just a huge disappointing port of voices over from 2010. (I thought this was a new game that hopefully was worked on for 4 years... looks like not at all.)-EA-Fun facts on each country or any other info are completely gone.-Common weird glitches with players colliding and flying like balls themselves.More thoughts:The biggest disappointment is that they were so lazy and probably late on the game that they did an eh job so they didn't make this game available for Xbox One or PS4.That alone, right there is not worth the $60 for an older console.If this were like $40 at launch it would have actually be more appealing.I say wait till World Cup starts, you'll be able to pick up a pre-owned copy of it for $40 or less.EA just continues it's fails with inability to release new games.From what I heard this happened before with another FIFA title.I think it was the FIFA13 that looked and worked exactly the same as FIFA12, just had a different number on the title.Now I don't want to focus on EA as a company, but to keep this as a game review.This game should have been more and could have been, but this one does not deserve the price tag or the 5 stars.You might as well go play FIFA WC 2010, the servers don't work in either one.UPDATE(4/19/14):After playing for quite sometime now, here are a few more things I'd like to update on.I did a little image comparison between the FIFA WC2010 and FIFA WC2014.- This version does have a slight improvement in graphics, but it is minimal.- Every single game I play, I get at least 2-3 offsides each match. This is ridiculous and makes gaming extremely stupid. The offsides is too sensitive and also the players tend to do it a lot.- In order to auto progress during qualifying (like skipping training and friendly matches), you have to press A at the current match, then press the right thumb stick, then you have a choice of advancing one match or going till the next match that you actually get to play in. This is annoying as after you finish your match it takes you to the regular calendar from where you can only view upcoming matches and just select advance. If they could just give us the ability to do all the autoplay and skipping on one calendar, playing the qualifying would have been so much more fun.If you have any questions, let me know and I'll try to answer to the best of my abilities. \n",

      "A very interesting take on the end of the Samurai era in Japan.  I just purchased this title earlier today, but so far I am already enthralled with it.  The first things I noticed about the game were: one, its very hard, and two, the story is amazingly open and varied.  On the difficulty end of things, there are very few save points and you only get one life; if you die the game is basically over.  The story plays out like and old samurai movie or Clint Eastwood western (think \"Yojimbo\" or \"Fistful of Dollars\"; you encounter warring factions in a small town and everyone seems to want to recruit you to help tip the balance of power in their favor.  However, the game never pushes you towards a specific direction.  Your character's choices remain refreshingly open ended as the plot develops.  You can fight, switch sides, or just sit back and watch while the npc's fight it out.  The game also has it's quircky Japanese moments, like the afro-haired samurai, and sometimes downright bizzare quips you can choose to taunt your oppents with during battle.  The bigest weak point in the game is definately in the graphics department.  The character faces are genuinly unique and fairly expressive, but the game itself is somewhat jaggy, and definately displays some texture seaming problems.  Another possible quible could come from the intitial dificulty level, which is fairly high.  However, starting from scratch often is not as bad in \"Samurai\" as in some other titles, because it alows the player a chance to view different possible story arcs.  One final not on the music: it's fairly eclectic, I personally enjoy it, but its probably not for everyone.  The rest of the in game sounds are fairly minimal, so if you want to listen to your stereo instead of the game you at least won't be missing anything important. \n",

      "Well, it has finally arrived. Street Fighter: Anniversary Edition includes Hyper Street Fighter II: The anniversary edition, Street Fighter III: Thrid Strike, as well as Street Fighter II the animated movie all for a great price of 30 bucks.The movie version that is included with this game, however, is plain awful. Poorly dubbed (\"Ryu, you are so, sen. si. tive!\") and sometimes the scene is cut off before the character can even finish the sentence. (\"How can I decline that invitat...)This game was released for the Sony Playstation 2 around summer of 04, but it did not have online capability like the Xbox version does. As soon as you get the game on Xbox Live, you are required to download something (I am being told that it fixes the rematch bug) as people who imported it earlier were having problems with rematches. Hyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition lets you pick between five character versions of SFII that were released. (Note: this does not include all 5 versions of the actual game, just the characters of those versions). Capcom has yet to fix the dropping issue found in Capcom vs SNK 2 EO, which I will not get into here, but most people already know what it is. I was really hoping they would solve that problem, but evidently not. Add in Street Fighter III: Third Strike and this is an excellent addition to your game collection. \n",

      "I bought this game to run on my 13.3\" Macbook Pro (2.53 GHz Intel core 2 duo, 4Gb ram , nvidia geforce 9400m) and it looks outstanding! Installation is a snap but takes nearly an hour.I was not ready for the wait when I installed this game but it WAS worth the wait.I find that the touchpad is actually superior to a mouse as my Microsoft 5000 wireless mouse was \"skippy\" in intense firefights.And finally , I have been unable to get the 1.7 patch to install.For those of you not familiar with the patch it allows you to play online against PC owners.Each time I attempt to install the patch it states my game files were damaged during installation and suggests I re-install.After the 3rd try I have given up on this feature.Other than that though this game is incredible and won't disappoint if you like single player BUT if online is your thing you MAY be disappointed.Perhaps you will have better luck with the patch than I did.Okay here I sit having finally figured out why I could not install the multi-player patch..........THE VERSION SOLD HERE ON AMAZON IS ALREADY VERSION 1.7!!!!!!!!! I just happened to see the game version on the loading screen one day and realized that my copy was produced after the original patch was first released.All those days of frustration installing , deleting and reinstalling were unnecessary.In hindsight though I wish I had never figured it out.Getting wasted over and over again by a bunch of prepubescent teens is humiliating beyond belief.Wish I could challenge them to the real thing then we'd really see who gets the prestige,lol. \n",

      "EDIT 12/29/2013: I ran into a horrible save bug. I lost ALL my progress over the last week. Not sure what caused it yet but I was exclusively playing this game and last night took the game out of the Xbox to watch a movie. When I reinserted the disc to play that is when I had to start all over.I am having a lot of fun playing this game but at times it is without a doubt the most frustrating game I have ever played. The frustrating part of the game is the cops, they are just too strong too quickly. For example, I am in a LONG race with 4 other racers. During this race we are crashing into each other and setting off shock waves and EMP's to damage the other persons car. So we get done with the race and our cars are pretty beat up. Now the cops arrive and can at times immediately ram your car and disable it which leads to you being busted which then causes you to lose ALL the points you just earned in that race. Without points you can's buy new cars or upgrade your current car. It is VERY frustrating. This is not to say that the game is possible because if you are careful and can get to a repair shop or hideout as soon as you are done racing you can get your points. The problem is that too often this is just not possible. EA needs to badly tune this game so that the cop AI isnt so brutal. I love a challenging game but most of the time the cop AI just gets cheap kills and that just is not fun.On the flip side you can play as the cops. This part of the game is tuned very well and is not frustrating at all. I personally do not enjoy playing as a cop as much as a racer but it does add a lot of replay value to the game.So I give this game 3.5 stars because there are a lot of positives.Pros:-Gorgeous graphics: weather and particle effects. Full day/night cycle.-Smooth frame rate-Large world with diverse scenery-Sounds are amazing-Controls are tightCons:-Cop AI is just too ruthlessI havent seen any bugs that some of the other reviewers are mentioning. I did just get the game for Christmas and there was a 350MB patch when I first installed it so that may have squashed them. \n",

I have not had any issues yet with my console (Knock on wood). I will say that there was no air bags in the packaging box. In fact, the only thing inside was the ps4 itself. So I was already concerned in addition to reading all the DOA units from Amazon pre orders. I would also like to chime in on the fan noise as this seems to be another issue making the forum rounds. The fan noise on mine sounds as it should and is actually much quieter than my ps3. All in all, I'm quite pleased with the ps4 thus far. \n",

Just like the one before it, this game is a little whacked but beautiful to watch. I felt like I was watching a movie at times. The artwork is utterly breathtaking! On to the not so great: the camera angles suck and make it difficult to truly enjoy the action at times. I HATE the block puzzles (seriously enough already) and if I am completely honest this game didn't surpass GOW 1 in PEA (Pure Epic Awesomeness!)

      "PLEASE NOTE: This review is one I wrote on another website. I did not purchase this from Amazon. Instead, I purchased this mouse on Newegg about 8-10 months ago. This is just an exact copy/paste about 8 months after the review was originally written. The mouse, to me, is still flawless.Pros: Durability - It's not exactly heavy, but you can definitely tell that it's SOLID. The cable is IMPOSSIBLE to tangle (How would you even tangle a mouse cable anyway?). The buttons provide just the right amount of resistance (for the most part. See cons). VERY good construction.Long cable - May be a headache for laptop users, but us desktop gamers LOVE these kinds of cables (as long as it's not excessive, and this certainly is NOT)Thumb grid isn't a gimmick. It really helps! This helps a lot in games like DC Universe, Champions Online, and World of Warcraft. Minecraft is also helped by this mouse. 1-9 for item selection, 10-12 for admin commands. However, other genres may be a pain (see cons).Easily configurable DPI, which is good, because with how high it'll go you'll pull your hair out. A few clicks and its lowered. 5600 is crazy. I normally keep it between 1600 and 2000.Comfort - See other thoughts. Ran out of room.Cons: Gets a tad' warm with the razer logo glowing.Thumb grid is HORRIBLE in a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER. Here's why.You're playing a game like Team Fortress 2, you're in an intense match. All the sudden you bump a button on the side. You suddenly go from your shotgun to your wrench and lose the battle. HOW TO AVOID: See other thoughts.Comfort - At first, this mouse will feel wierd as can be. You hardly notice the thumb grid, but there's a wrest on the side of the mouse for your ring finger. Most mice don't have this, and it takes a long while to get used to it. Took me about a week.Other Thoughts: COMFORT - See cons before reading this. Once you're used to the rest on the side of the mouse, it's easier to move this mouse around than any other mouse you'll use. The thumb grid is actually a nice fit in your hand and is very easy to use (although it takes a while to get used to)You can avoid the FPS problem easily. There is a switch on the bottom of the mouse to go between 2 sets of macros. Change the second set to something that does nothing in any of your games. Use that in an FPS. Perhaps set 2 for a DPI change, but that's about it. This will solve a lot of potential headaches.OVERALL this is an AMAZING mouse. Got it on Newegg for ~65 if my memory is correct, perhaps 70. Will definitely buy another naga, even if the price were to go UP. This mouse I would say is worth a 100 dollar price tag. Don't even hesitate, buy this mouse! \n",

Found one at a yard sale for $20 so I got it as I was making a trip and wanted something cold to drink.  It didn't work either. Figured I got burnt for the 20. Found one on Amazon and decided to try it. I put ice cold soda in it from the fridge, put it in the car and started on a 300 mile trip. I made sure the unit was turned on and running. After about 150 miles, I decided I wanted to drink. Has anyone ever drank warm Mountain Dew??  The cans were cold when they went in but warm when I stopped to have one.

      "Product looks good and was easy to install. However, that's the end of my positive comments about this product...!I read the reviews about install nightmares.  Those had to have been written by somebody who has a hard time telling a screwdriver from a wrench. Removal and install took a total of 10 minutes.  It would have taken less, but the seal was not pre-attached to the light. But I'm getting ahead of myself...The product comes with the light.... That's it... Nothing else.. No purchase warranty or company contact information. No advertisement of additional products or even a sticker to advertise their company.  No installation instructions, No additional hardware, like screws or washers. So you better pray that your existing screws and washers are not rusted or stripped out.The product descriptions claims &#34;Super bright LED for superior visibility&#34;. I completely disagree with that claim. It's barley bright enough to see during the day, much less at night. My previous light (also aftermarket) was bright enough to blind you during the day. Not this one.Product quality of manufacture is sketchy. Mount holes were both closed with extra bleed over plastic from casting. Was nothing to pop the whole out, but does speak to quality of craftsmanship.  There were other places on the internal of the light that had the same bleed over from casting but had no affect on the install.Product comes with no manufactures warranty.Overall I would never order from this company (Spyder Auto) again.  I'm just praying it lasts longer than 12 months... \n",

I don't know if it was a bad batch or if the quality of the product was just bad, it was more thinner/reducer than paint, no amount of shaking would do any good, it remained very liquid. It was just extremely watery it had the color and consistency of blood. I applied one coat and it was so thin I could still see the black base metal of the chip i was trying to cover, so it didnt do its job.

      "Just wanted to publicize the fact that a Samsung HL-R4266WX's may incorrectly list the L6 chassis (L64C to be specific) on the sticker on the back of the TV. Mine does but, as I found out, actually takes the one for the L3 chassis (part #BP96-00674A). I discovered this as result of trying to install the color wheel I received and cracking one of the color segments on the wheel. (This occurred because the L6 part sat lower than the L3 would have.) Upon further research, I then realized that the part I was replacing was actually the -00674A. They are distinct parts, most significantly in the size and shape of the rubber seals on each. So, before you order, remove the part and compare its appearance with the ones on here. It may save you the 80 bucks that I didn't.By the way, no response from Samsung Direct Parts Warehouse when I sent them an email making them aware of this issue. (Keeping it real professional guys...) So I ordered my BP96-00674A part from Union Electronic Distributors, 110 bucks, including shipping: [...] Had to holler at it. \n",

      "This armrest is ok, but I feel it could be better.  It's better than nothing, but it was a gift to my dad and I was a little disappointed.  I have 2 main problems with it: 1. It's just too soft.  That sounds weird to say, but it really is just too soft.  I wish they had used a higher-density foam inside.  2. I also wish it sat farther forward.  I'm about 5'10\" and my dad is about the same and when the seat is adjusted to a normal and comfortable position for our size, the pad is so far back between the seats that our elbows only make contact with the front edge of the armrest.  I'm considering cutting the bracket and rewelding it farther forward, about flush with the front of the top of the center console, so our elbows have something to sit on.  Honestly, for the money, I'd look at other armrests out there. \n",

      "Couldn't live without a Cruise Control in my 1997 Toyota Corolla which I just bought! Rostra offered left and right column mount controls as well as dash mount units. I would definitely suggest the column mount. I picked the right side mounted unit as I only had the windshield washer stalk on that side. Left side already had the stalks for the lights and wheel tilt and I thought it might be a little crowded. Turns out after installing it that it easily would have fit on the left (different part number). Depending on your preference or experience with other vehicles, either side would have worked fine. Dropping off the bottom of the steering column was easy on my vehicle and then it was simple to drill the hole to mount it through. You will want to be certain that you check for clearance on the column itself for the stub of the stalk and the wiring. You will also want to be sure that if your other column mounted items move, that they don't move into the location of the new cruise control switch. Otherwise, after finding a good location for installing it and then the hook-up to the actual cruise control unit was a breeze with just a simple pig tail to plug in. The &#34;touch&#34; to set the controls on this control switch is very &#34;soft.&#34; I sometimes brush by it when tuning the radio and disengage it. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 star is because this comes with a green LED light on it and it is so pale that during daylight hours it is next to impossible to tell if it is on or not. This really should be improved. I spend time looking away from the road and attempting to shield around the light to see if it is indeed on or not. There's no good reason for this to not be a more readily visible light. It shows fine after it is rather dark. After about 2000 miles of mixed driving I'm happy with the unit. \n",

The paint being reviewed here is the \"Gloss\" celery.  These two cans I used were used to repaint some old wicker chairs and two metal lawn chairs.  The wicker was no problem what so ever.  The paint went on smooth and evenly and was not overly thick or too thin.  The metal chairs of course needed quite a bit of prep work but it paid off and this paint did the job I pain for it to do.One can of this stuff will go a long, long way and two cans were more than adequate to finish the job.I have used Krylon before on outdoor and indeed, indoor projects.  It is very durable, goes on smooth and I have no complaints.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks \n",

I need prescription lens and my local place admitted they couldn't do it for what Bobster charges (~ $90). I sent them in to SoCa and the fun began. Bobster customer service is an answering machine. It takes at least three calls and/or e-mails to get a reply. Sometimes they call, sometimes an e-mail. Maybe.After several hoops and delays on their end, they were &#34;rushed&#34; ordered to their eye guys. After two months, I got them back the same day I receive a message telling me to mail them back because they had switched mine with another customer's. Back they go the next day and then they e-mail me stating their was no mix up just keep them. Little late, Bobster.Last weekend was cold and windy for our Toys for Tots ride and they functioned very well. Comfortable even with the strap under the helmet; no fogging even with a face mask on.

      "My title says it all. After having read reviews i was totally hyped up about it, but after receiving it and using it for the first time it stopped working on me. The power would shut off after turning it on for 15-30 sec. When i called customer service from Hoover they told me it's a built in manufacturer default if your bag is full, but my question is \"How can it be full after first use?\" dumbfounded? I know, i was too. Then after 30 min on the phone with rep they said to drop it off at Sears (Hoover's service center). So here's where the story gets even better... After dropping it off i was told it would take 4-6wks. And i was ok with that. Then 6 wks. goes by so the logical thing i thought was to call Hoover, i left 2 or 3 messages... and i hear nothing back regarding the status of my vacuum still. Finally, Sears calls me to bill me $400 some ridiculous amount for the service repair (which i was told was under warranty for the manufacturer repair). Ummm, hello?!!! I shouldn't have to spend over $200 for my new vacuum and it have a defect after first use AND pay $400 for the repair!! Anyone with me here on this? I could buy 2 more sets of hoover's defective 'Platinum' vacuum at that price!!!! And have a 50/50 chance that one isn't going to quit on me after first use! So once again, i have to call hoover rep back (again having to leave a message) and i finally get a call back 8 wks into this whole drama from a hoover rep and now i'm told it will be another 2-3 wks before it gets done. \"Seriously?\" Let's think through this logically after knowing this whole scenario: if its defective after first use, they should have just sent me a new one!1) i paid for a new vacuum, and had i known the customer service was going to be like this and the vacuum that had such great reviews was going to break after first use, i would have been better off buying a REFURBISHED vacuum (which is pretty much what i ended up with)2) it obviously cost money (apparently over $400) for repairs, so why not just replace mine?!!!3) if they would have replaced mine, it probably would have been expedited a lot faster than the 9 wks i had to wait for my vacuum to be repairedSo in conclusion, shouldn't hoover have thought \"Hmmm, let's keep our customer happy and just replace the vacuum?\"Yeah, you would think. If i could, i would give this product and the poor hoover customer service a big fat ZERO on review. \n",

It's like the Folger's or Maxwell House of the espresso world: best for those whose only desire is to dose caffeine into their system in 1-2 oz increments.Anyone passionate about coffee will likely tire of this machine rapidly as options for roasts are limited and none are nearly as good or complex as what can be produced from a standard espresso machine.  If you're looking for good espresso on a budget, I'd suggest taking a look at a Mypressi Twist and Zassenhaus hand grinder. \n",

I used a 16-inch disposable decorating bag as specified in the instructions.  But, I could not get batter to flow through the valve. You can only apply so much pressure before batter starts coming out the open end, regardless of how little batter you put in the bag. I didn't have time to mess around with batter quantity in the bag. I ended up removing the batter tip. The batter flowed and the tip base made it easy to hold the end of the bag to guide it while dispensing, but you can get this rigidness by using a large decorating tip. Not sure I'll be using it again. Very disappointing. \n",

The coffeemaker had been leaking for quite some time so, quite frankly, I'm glad to see it go. When the first unit failed (out of warranty) I called Cuisinart and learned that the coffemaker is not repairable. Within warranty they just replace it. There are no repair parts available for out-of-warranty repair. The units seem to work for just under four years. The warranty is for three years. Yes, the DCC-1200 makes good coffee but it appears they are designed to fail. Our usage was just one pot of coffee a day, not exactly heavy usage. And yes, we cleaned/descaled it on a regular basis. \n",

It is constructed of panels of some kind of fiber board that is about 1/8 inch thick,  each framed by 2\" by 1/2\" slats.  I had to reinforce the inside corners with scrap wood,  as well as glue it back together - parts of it were falling apart when I got it.The paint job was negligible,  barely a primer coat - I could see the base material through it.  I had to apply three coats of paint to make it look right.  Considering that the product is made in China,  I'm probably better off having sealed it up in fresh paint that I KNOW doesn't contain lead or who knows what else.I will NEVER buy furniture online again.  Over and over I have read reviews by others for other furniture that is similar to mine.  This piece of junk may be worth $20 (shipping included) - but nowhere near the $60 that I paid for it.

      "This spice rack is one of those little things that delights in it perfect design. The space taken up by the rack would be empty - air - space within your cabinet. With this rack, the space is used effectively and neatly, and all behind closed doors.It is a wonderful, functional use of space. It fits snugly in standard size cabinets. The drawers slide easily. There is a stop that prevents drawers from coming out and dropping the contents. As the drawer reaches that stop, it is allowed to drop down at a slight angle so that it hangs there, unsupported, allowing you to view the contents as you search for the item you want.I came into the Amazon today to order my third one as I have one in my baking area for the extracts and colored sprinkles etc The one by the stove is full and I need a second one over there for more of my spices. \n",

      "Seriously, I have ALWAYS wanted one of these puzzle storage units. As I only work a couple of puzzles a year, however, it seemed an extravagance and a luxury item. I was thrilled to get my hands on this new toy and am, in truth, a bit disappointed.Pros:Perfect size for standard 1000 piece puzzles.Self contained, no more cluttering up table tops for extended periods.Extra room to sort pieces with a few large compartments.Closes up for easy flat storage (under bed, couch)Cons:Simply not effective for transport unless kept flat.Nothing keeps pieces from sliding when unit is vertical.There are two main functions in such a device. Storage and transport. This fails on the transportation aspect, and that's a pretty big let-down. The product description promises that the snap tight case will prevent this and it does not. There are even carrying handles implying that this is a normal expectation. Truthfully, how often do you need to carry your puzzle around? Probably not very often. As a work surface, this is just fine. And if that's all you need, by all means--this is terrific. But I've got to score the product accordingly for not fulfilling its promises as listed in the product description. KGHarris, 9/11. \n",

      "This is basically an Air Hogs Zero Gravity vehicle chassis with vacuum formed arms and legs that move. The chassis seems durable and agile enough to drive around on walls quickly, but the overall effect is unsettling. The arms and legs are made from plastic with the thickness of a cheap Halloween mask. Very flimsy limbs. I suppose this is necessary in order to keep it lightweight. When the toy is driving around on the wall at an unnatural and inhuman speed, the arms and legs flap around and seem rubbery. The speed is definitely not \"to scale\". Also, this thing is LOUD. At first, my 3 year old found it freaky enough to be afraid of it, and asked that it be put away. Once he got over that and got the hang of steering, it seems he found the sound and movement irritating. Again, I was asked to put it away. We'll give it another shot tomorrow, we'll see how long it lasts. I think this would be cooler in the form of a scorpion, alien face hugger, or the baby from Trainspotting. Not so much as Spider-Man. Not cute, not elegant. Makes a great B-movie prop. Kill it with fire! \n",

      "Unlike the supposed success of the original review of this toy, we did not have such luck. Two parents attempted to put it together and after hours of trying to get it to work (crawl hand over hand across a string), it would not work. It is not designed well at all. The weight of the monkey pulls it to the side and the \"hand\" does not connect with the string. The hands seem to be at an incorrect angle for them to be in the right position to catch the string. It would not work going forward or backward.  We double checked all of the steps and are sure we had it built right. Maybe we will have more luck with some of the other designs.As for durability, if it missed the string and fell to the ground, it fell all to pieces.The cover is also misleading - saying you can make 17 different things with it. I'm sure you can, but they only give you 6 plans, not 17. These lego things are so complicated that unless you have the detailed designs, I don't see how they expect you to be able to make those other 11 items, especially if you are only an 8 yr old.Our son was so disappointed that it would not climb the string. That was a shame since it took a couple of hours to put it together and then nothing. \n",

So this Christmas I decided to make him a QUALITY doctor set, something that would help him learn and expand as opposed to a bunch of plastic dodads that would just take up space in the play area.This stethoscope was the absolute icing on the cake for his set. He use to pretend to listen to peoples heart with the pretend plastic one that came with his doctor costume, but now he can ACTUALLY listen to heartbeats thanks to this.

      "This is a very neat Samus Aran action figure - but the emphasis is definitely on the posing and static display of Samus rather than having her in the hands of a 10-year old chasing down bad guys on the family room floor.  The Samus I received only had one minor paint blemish but the rest of the figure shined and looked great.  The included posing stand is very helpful for putting her in all sorts of action-y positions.  The figure is a little small in my opinion, considering the cost.  The box states that this is not for those under 15, and they mean it.  I accidentally popped a leg off myself - but putting it back on was easy.  However, a child would destroy Samus in a way that Ridley and the Space Pirates never could. \n",

      "I am coming from the wired version of the Razer Naga mouse, so I was really hopeful that I would find something here that addresses all the little flaws of that mouse while keeping its awesomeness.  On paper, it does.  But when I tried to use it...The mouse is HUGE.  I am a 6'0 male so I do not have tiny hands or anything, and it felt enormous in my hand.  To make that worse, the buttons are sensitive to light presses, and that G-Shift button under your ring finger was getting pressed all the time, I would even hit the right mouse button on occasion when I was trying to adjust my grip to not hit the G-Shift button.  I felt like I couldn't acutally let my hand rest comfortably on the mouse without pressing stuff.Ignoring all that, I'm sure the mouse would be fine.  The indented side buttons feel weird after being used to the Naga, but would probably be good once you got used to it.  It's nice you can change the backlight color to anything.  Build quality is good, software seems good.  The G-Shift button is a great IDEA, but I just can't use it.I've never seen something so awesome on paper, so well thought out feature-wise, be so poorly implemented from an ergonomic/usability perspective.  I'm returning mine and going back to my Naga mouse. \n",

      "I give Power A props for trying to improve on the antiquated design of the Sony controller.  However, the poor right stick placement and huge dead zone just negate the point of the redesign.I absolutely loath the Playstation controller's analog stick placement.  So when I saw this controller, which looked like a replica of the 360's, I was thrilled.  It has a really solid feel and the grip is a nice touch.  The left stick is exactly where it should be.  However, the right stick is still too far of a reach.  My right thumb felt very awkward the whole time and I simply could not get into the FPS groove like I can on the 360.  And to make it worse, those who mentioned the huge dead zone where spot on!  I was able to move the sticks almost a quarter-inch without a response.  Finally, the problem that sealed the return was the fact that the transceiver simply stopped working after about 30 minutes of play.I do not recommend this controller for those looking to replicate 360 experience on the PS3.Pros: Great, solid feel. Left thumb stick is right where it should be.Cons: VERY uncomfortable right thumb stick placement. HUGE analog stick dead zone. \n",

Gone are the Euro- and J-pop style of music I love on the PS2 and the arcade.  Instead, you are treated to bad disco tunes and covers of 80s and 90s dance tunes that went out with Milli Vanilli.  Your dancer is accompanied by four synchronized dancers that frequently hold their arms out like children playing \"airplane\" and then run around in a circle.It all amuses my one year old, but no one else in the family will touch it.Quite frankly, it strikes me as if the DDR team watched \"Moulin Rouge\" and \"Saturday Night Fever\" back to back, did some ecstacy, went to a gay disco to try out their moves, then went back to work and stuffed their experience in a box for your entertainment.Eagerly awaiting DDR Extreme 3 or whatever else is next on the PS2... \n",

      "A very interesting take on the end of the Samurai era in Japan.  I just purchased this title earlier today, but so far I am already enthralled with it.  The first things I noticed about the game were: one, its very hard, and two, the story is amazingly open and varied.  On the difficulty end of things, there are very few save points and you only get one life; if you die the game is basically over.  The story plays out like and old samurai movie or Clint Eastwood western (think \"Yojimbo\" or \"Fistful of Dollars\"; you encounter warring factions in a small town and everyone seems to want to recruit you to help tip the balance of power in their favor.  However, the game never pushes you towards a specific direction.  Your character's choices remain refreshingly open ended as the plot develops.  You can fight, switch sides, or just sit back and watch while the npc's fight it out.  The game also has it's quircky Japanese moments, like the afro-haired samurai, and sometimes downright bizzare quips you can choose to taunt your oppents with during battle.  The bigest weak point in the game is definately in the graphics department.  The character faces are genuinly unique and fairly expressive, but the game itself is somewhat jaggy, and definately displays some texture seaming problems.  Another possible quible could come from the intitial dificulty level, which is fairly high.  However, starting from scratch often is not as bad in \"Samurai\" as in some other titles, because it alows the player a chance to view different possible story arcs.  One final not on the music: it's fairly eclectic, I personally enjoy it, but its probably not for everyone.  The rest of the in game sounds are fairly minimal, so if you want to listen to your stereo instead of the game you at least won't be missing anything important. \n",

      "The 360 wireless controller is one nice piece of hardware.  I own a video game store and i know a thing about them.  some of the reviews ive read here gave it a low score for a couple reasons.  one when you get a new wireless controller you need to sync with your system for it to work.  Push the tiny button on the top of the unit and the button on the front of the 360 at close to the same time.  then it will sync and work properly. the second thing people seem to complain about is how many batteries they go through.  like any modern electronic device that uses batteries cheap \"store brand\" batteries will die very very fast, like in a few days time inside one of these controllers.  I would strongly suggest getting batteries that are made for use in demanding electronic devices and they generally will say so right on the package.  I play my 360 ALOT and usually a good set of batteries will last me 2 - 3 weeks.  hope this helps \n",

      "Before this game came out I was really excited, I love the 64 one and Friends of Mineral Town is Okay. When my freind got the game I was admittedly a little dissapointed,but two months later a kid at school said it was great. The next day at my friends house I forced myself to play past the first day. The more I played the more I loved it. Infact my freind (who hadn't played the game since she got it) pushed me aside and started playing. Needless to say the next day I got the game. I'm hooked now. The festivles aren't very good but besides thatit's the best. and because things change every year it doesn't become too repetitive which was my one problem with 64. It also has beatiful graghics, like for instance the cows look real! Your son is really cute too! So I definatley recomend this game. It brings harvest moon to a whole new level. \n",

      "I have played 2k basketball for a very long time.  It is the only reason I even own a video game console, so I'm pretty familiar with the normal love and gripes 2k enthusiasts have for this game.  For people new to basketball games, 2k is ALWAYS the best one out there.  NBA live is absolutely terrible and has been for years.NBA 2k11 is a fantastic game, and I would give it 4.5 stars, but Amazon won't let me do it.  I just can't give it 5 stars because of the online play.  I have a fantastic internet connection in my home, but the 2k serves constantly crash and take forever to play a ranked game.  Until 2k fixes this garbage, people are always gonna be pissed.That being said, 2k has taken it to another level with this game.  The addition of the Michael Jordan teams and the rival teams is just ridiculous, and that alone can keep you occupied for hours.  For those who want a great basketball simulation, this is the game for you.  For people who want more of an arcade experience, this game is going to be very frustrating.  Maybe NBA jam is more up your alley?Anyways, the simulation aspect of this game is great, and the individual teams actually play like they do in real life.  A lot of things are harder in this game, but the general feel is way more realistic and intuitive than past titles fo the game.If you like sports video games, this might be the best one to come out in years.  Let's just hope 2k doesn't blow it next year now..... \n",

      "i am in iraq and really wanted to play some guitar hero games, but not wanting to bring my ps3 over here, i had my wife send me a ps2 and just bit the bullet and bought some of the games that i already had again for ps2.  i was a little cautious about this one because of some of the reviews already posted for ps2, but i feel like the people writing those reviews had unrealistic expectations for the game.  You should know before you buy this that there are no challenges, no way to include songs from older games or buy new songs on the playstation store, and do not count on party play at all, because it basically doesn't exist.  all of that aside, you still get all of the songs from the ps3 version, which i think is 85.  the graphics are still awesome for ps2 and all of the character movements and looks have been improved.  one thing that you may or may not like is that if you've seen the way the notes and the highway look on ps3, they are not like that one this one, they look more the way guitar hero 3 or world tour was.  also, people had complained about loading times, but i don't notice much difference between this and the ps3 version.  overall, still an awesome game and as long as you can sacrifice a few features that are not necessary to enjoy the game, you should like it. \n",

      "I am not a PC gamer and I prefer a track ball over a mouse...but I bought this because I'm really into Tron and liked the looks of it.The mouse itself is corded but that's really it's only drawback.  It is a good size (and I have big hands) and the side buttons are not easily activated on accident, an issue I've had with side button mice in the past.  The software driver allows for editing just about every aspect of it's performance from button reassignment to macro assignment.  These are probably pretty standard features for a gaming mouse like this.The mousepad, however, is where the magic is.  The mouse really does leave a noticable light trail on it.  The movement across the pad is about as frictionless as a mouse can be.  You need to be in a pretty dark environment to notice the light trail, but if you let it sit on one spot for more than 5 seconds, it will leave a clearly visible mark on the pad.  I do not think I've ever seen any sort of product like this before.  Very original.I am a Mac user, and there is no driver support for Mac yet.  This is the only reason I am giving this product 4 instead of 5 stars.  I actually prefer it being corded, but there is no excuse to not offer Mac support.  But for PC gaming or, in my case, just general use on a windows machine, this thing is perfect. \n",

      "Product looks good and was easy to install. However, that's the end of my positive comments about this product...!I read the reviews about install nightmares.  Those had to have been written by somebody who has a hard time telling a screwdriver from a wrench. Removal and install took a total of 10 minutes.  It would have taken less, but the seal was not pre-attached to the light. But I'm getting ahead of myself...The product comes with the light.... That's it... Nothing else.. No purchase warranty or company contact information. No advertisement of additional products or even a sticker to advertise their company.  No installation instructions, No additional hardware, like screws or washers. So you better pray that your existing screws and washers are not rusted or stripped out.The product descriptions claims &#34;Super bright LED for superior visibility&#34;. I completely disagree with that claim. It's barley bright enough to see during the day, much less at night. My previous light (also aftermarket) was bright enough to blind you during the day. Not this one.Product quality of manufacture is sketchy. Mount holes were both closed with extra bleed over plastic from casting. Was nothing to pop the whole out, but does speak to quality of craftsmanship.  There were other places on the internal of the light that had the same bleed over from casting but had no affect on the install.Product comes with no manufactures warranty.Overall I would never order from this company (Spyder Auto) again.  I'm just praying it lasts longer than 12 months... \n",

      "This armrest is ok, but I feel it could be better.  It's better than nothing, but it was a gift to my dad and I was a little disappointed.  I have 2 main problems with it: 1. It's just too soft.  That sounds weird to say, but it really is just too soft.  I wish they had used a higher-density foam inside.  2. I also wish it sat farther forward.  I'm about 5'10\" and my dad is about the same and when the seat is adjusted to a normal and comfortable position for our size, the pad is so far back between the seats that our elbows only make contact with the front edge of the armrest.  I'm considering cutting the bracket and rewelding it farther forward, about flush with the front of the top of the center console, so our elbows have something to sit on.  Honestly, for the money, I'd look at other armrests out there. \n",

      "Couldn't live without a Cruise Control in my 1997 Toyota Corolla which I just bought! Rostra offered left and right column mount controls as well as dash mount units. I would definitely suggest the column mount. I picked the right side mounted unit as I only had the windshield washer stalk on that side. Left side already had the stalks for the lights and wheel tilt and I thought it might be a little crowded. Turns out after installing it that it easily would have fit on the left (different part number). Depending on your preference or experience with other vehicles, either side would have worked fine. Dropping off the bottom of the steering column was easy on my vehicle and then it was simple to drill the hole to mount it through. You will want to be certain that you check for clearance on the column itself for the stub of the stalk and the wiring. You will also want to be sure that if your other column mounted items move, that they don't move into the location of the new cruise control switch. Otherwise, after finding a good location for installing it and then the hook-up to the actual cruise control unit was a breeze with just a simple pig tail to plug in. The &#34;touch&#34; to set the controls on this control switch is very &#34;soft.&#34; I sometimes brush by it when tuning the radio and disengage it. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 star is because this comes with a green LED light on it and it is so pale that during daylight hours it is next to impossible to tell if it is on or not. This really should be improved. I spend time looking away from the road and attempting to shield around the light to see if it is indeed on or not. There's no good reason for this to not be a more readily visible light. It shows fine after it is rather dark. After about 2000 miles of mixed driving I'm happy with the unit. \n",

However there are a couple things about it that do rub me the wrong way. The leads are not very good quality, I have seen reviews where the leads don't even work upon opening of item. My leads fortunately worked, but started to break fairly quickly. The Black lead is almost bad due to the cord literally ripping off where the pen meets the wire. I have never mistreated this meter, it is from regular wear and tear. Its has only been a few months and now I have to already buy new leads. In addition if you are looking at this meter because of its capacitance meter, this is not the meter for you.

      "If you need to clean the inside of the lid follow this for better effect:> There is a metal screw which holds together the sealing mechanism comprised of the open/close button to the internal stopper.  The screw is under the actuating button on the top of the lid. To get to the screw you will need to pry off the plastic portion of the button.1. Close the seal, button should be up.2. While holding the lid in your left hand with some pressure on the internal stopper, take a small flat screw driver or knife, reach down the side of the button and pry up on each side, alternating, until you work the button loose.  The plastic portion is about 1/8 inch high on the sides and is held to stem of the seal with two small protrusions at the smaller ends of the ellipse.  The plastic button sits directly on a flange of similar size so be careful to not reach in too deeply or damage the flange. Try not to remove the rubber portion as it is glued to the top of the button and will need to be re-glued if removed3. You will find the head of a small screw and will need to un-screw it with a small Phillips head screw driver.  Grasping the stopper in your left hand turn the Philips head screw in the counter clockwise direction until the screw is free.  Set the screw aside and don't loose it.4. Grasp the lid in your right hand with the top towards your palm, pull on the bottom portion of the internal stopper with your left hand until free.  Be careful to do this over a towel on a counter as there is a detent cam and spiral compression spring below the top portion of the stopper mechanism.5. With the internal stopper removed, The internal portion of the lid is exposed.6. Clean well. On the internal stopper is a rubber ring seal that can be removed.  To do this pinch the seal and pull gently away while lifting off7. Reassembly is the reverse.  However there is several points that will need to be followed.7A. The ring seal has a flat side and a stepped side.  The stepped side goes towards the bottom of the stopper, flat side towards the lid.7B. The spring goes below the cam with the larger end up towards the cam.  The cam goes in with the ears up towards the button.  An easy way to accomplish this assembly is to thread the cam and spring on the Phillips head screw driver for guidance into the lid.  The cam has four external guides which will need to be fit to those in the lid.7C. Do not over tighten the screw.7D. If the plastic button will not stay on then the screw can be replaced with a longer one and be threaded through the plastic button after drilling a hole in the center of the button.  I recommend rubber cement for re-attachment of the rubber portion. \n",

      "This is basically an Air Hogs Zero Gravity vehicle chassis with vacuum formed arms and legs that move. The chassis seems durable and agile enough to drive around on walls quickly, but the overall effect is unsettling. The arms and legs are made from plastic with the thickness of a cheap Halloween mask. Very flimsy limbs. I suppose this is necessary in order to keep it lightweight. When the toy is driving around on the wall at an unnatural and inhuman speed, the arms and legs flap around and seem rubbery. The speed is definitely not \"to scale\". Also, this thing is LOUD. At first, my 3 year old found it freaky enough to be afraid of it, and asked that it be put away. Once he got over that and got the hang of steering, it seems he found the sound and movement irritating. Again, I was asked to put it away. We'll give it another shot tomorrow, we'll see how long it lasts. I think this would be cooler in the form of a scorpion, alien face hugger, or the baby from Trainspotting. Not so much as Spider-Man. Not cute, not elegant. Makes a great B-movie prop. Kill it with fire! \n",

I have a lot of health issues, and have been hospitalized multiple times, so playing doctor is one of the ways my son deals with his anxieties and fears about it all. Its really given him a sense of empowerment to understand what hospitals are for and what doctors really do. So this Christmas I decided to make him a QUALITY doctor set, something that would help him learn and expand as opposed to a bunch of plastic dodads that would just take up space in the play area.This stethoscope was the absolute icing on the cake for his set. He use to pretend to listen to peoples heart with the pretend plastic one that came with his doctor costume, but now he can ACTUALLY listen to heartbeats thanks to this. He listens to EVERYONE that will let him (especially enjoys listening to mama's belly since baby brother is in there and due very soon.) Its worth every cent. \n",

I wrote the below as a comment to someone else:This set is very helpful to merge the tracks down Thomas & FriendsThomas & Friends: TrackMaster Switch Track Packto a more managable level. Since the set only comes with two of the bottom Y's, you would need two sets, one for each side of the station to get 2 tracks expanding to four into the station and from four to two again when leaving the station.

There are only 3 different car types: loose (great speed, no handling), Neutral (average speed and handling), and tight (no speed and great handling).

The gameboard itself is very small and the letters seem scrunched together.  Although the package states that it is compatible with Windows 7, the game tends to get wonky after a few minutes and then stops working for no apparent reason.  The game itself is not very challenging unless you're a real beginner, as in never having played Scrabble in any form before.  Some very simple words don't seem to be in this game's dictionary.  The computerized opponents don't really play many words, they just pass and exchange tiles throughout the game.  Very boring! I'll be playing my older versions of Scrabble. \n",

      "I give Power A props for trying to improve on the antiquated design of the Sony controller.  However, the poor right stick placement and huge dead zone just negate the point of the redesign.I absolutely loath the Playstation controller's analog stick placement.  So when I saw this controller, which looked like a replica of the 360's, I was thrilled.  It has a really solid feel and the grip is a nice touch.  The left stick is exactly where it should be.  However, the right stick is still too far of a reach.  My right thumb felt very awkward the whole time and I simply could not get into the FPS groove like I can on the 360.  And to make it worse, those who mentioned the huge dead zone where spot on!  I was able to move the sticks almost a quarter-inch without a response.  Finally, the problem that sealed the return was the fact that the transceiver simply stopped working after about 30 minutes of play.I do not recommend this controller for those looking to replicate 360 experience on the PS3.Pros: Great, solid feel. Left thumb stick is right where it should be.Cons: VERY uncomfortable right thumb stick placement. HUGE analog stick dead zone. \n",

      "This game has been in development for quite a while, and in some parts it shows and in other parts it looks like the game was put together in a week.  Based on today's standards there wasn't really a lot that drew me in.  The graphics are nothing the ps2 couldn't muster, and the music pales to the 16-bit iterations.  The player models look really funny.  Backgrounds are really still and boring, and no walls are used.  A lot of the background themes do not relate at all to the series.  Didn't mortal kombat 3 have crumbling stages?  The sound effects are not mixed well enough together, but are passable.  Player chatter is extremely weak, compared to other titles in similar genres.  Speaking of fighters, if you ever play games like virtua fighter 4, tekken 3, and soul calibur this just doesn't live up to that, so that may be in your head.  also, the animation is not a pretty sight to behold.  The special moves are horrible, again the 16-bit versions upstage DA in this category.  And where are the stables like sheng tsung's morph, scorpion's teleport, and others??  Also, the controls are not responsive to what you press until over a half-second.  Gameplay is not balanced at all, the weapons are too strong. Performing moves overall seems sporatic.  I also will say the story [stinks], endings [stinks], and game modes [sucks].  Konquest sounds cool, but all it is is just a repetitive training level...zzz..zz.  And it floors me that midway omitted stage fatalities, something in mortal kombat ONE, and then decided to go with 1 fatality per person.  They were wasting time trying to mimic other fighters mode's instead, instead the could of had hundred's of fatalities on the xbox's hardrive.  Overall Mortal Kombat deadly allience isn't worth the money, anything noteworthy it does another fighter on the market does much better. \n",

The Z button was broken when i got it, it clearly doesn't say ANYTHING about being a knock off, like it should and it doesn't even at least say its a 3rd party.  They (and by they i mean the sick company that made them) are smart enough to never say Nintendo on the packaging or even the controllers themselves. They work (like crap anyway) but they have a lot of flaws.A. Broken buttonsB. It feels like cheap plastic and smooth like the orignal ones.C. The Joystick is extremely sensitive.D. The L and R buttons don't click, they are hard to push down and stick.E. The X and Y where non responsive in rapid secessionF. The controllers are NOT real nintendo made gamecube controllers.If just one of the 2 controllers i got had a broken Z button, how long until they both brake? Don't be cheap people, these controllers are made from cheap parts and will probably break very, very soon after you open them.If it looks to good to be true people, it is. Shop smart. \n",

      "The 360 wireless controller is one nice piece of hardware.  I own a video game store and i know a thing about them.  some of the reviews ive read here gave it a low score for a couple reasons.  one when you get a new wireless controller you need to sync with your system for it to work.  Push the tiny button on the top of the unit and the button on the front of the 360 at close to the same time.  then it will sync and work properly. the second thing people seem to complain about is how many batteries they go through.  like any modern electronic device that uses batteries cheap \"store brand\" batteries will die very very fast, like in a few days time inside one of these controllers.  I would strongly suggest getting batteries that are made for use in demanding electronic devices and they generally will say so right on the package.  I play my 360 ALOT and usually a good set of batteries will last me 2 - 3 weeks.  hope this helps \n",

      "A very interesting take on the end of the Samurai era in Japan.  I just purchased this title earlier today, but so far I am already enthralled with it.  The first things I noticed about the game were: one, its very hard, and two, the story is amazingly open and varied.  On the difficulty end of things, there are very few save points and you only get one life; if you die the game is basically over.  The story plays out like and old samurai movie or Clint Eastwood western (think \"Yojimbo\" or \"Fistful of Dollars\"; you encounter warring factions in a small town and everyone seems to want to recruit you to help tip the balance of power in their favor.  However, the game never pushes you towards a specific direction.  Your character's choices remain refreshingly open ended as the plot develops.  You can fight, switch sides, or just sit back and watch while the npc's fight it out.  The game also has it's quircky Japanese moments, like the afro-haired samurai, and sometimes downright bizzare quips you can choose to taunt your oppents with during battle.  The bigest weak point in the game is definately in the graphics department.  The character faces are genuinly unique and fairly expressive, but the game itself is somewhat jaggy, and definately displays some texture seaming problems.  Another possible quible could come from the intitial dificulty level, which is fairly high.  However, starting from scratch often is not as bad in \"Samurai\" as in some other titles, because it alows the player a chance to view different possible story arcs.  One final not on the music: it's fairly eclectic, I personally enjoy it, but its probably not for everyone.  The rest of the in game sounds are fairly minimal, so if you want to listen to your stereo instead of the game you at least won't be missing anything important. \n",

It's fun and exciting enough for me to give it four stars, but I believe this is really a rental title.  If you buy it, you are wasting your money.  The fun and excitement wane quickly and the gameplay grows old fast.  For me, after a couple days of knocking out other vehicles and setting off chaos, I had had enough.  There's actually a wealth of \"missions\" included, but they are all similar to one another, so for me, the allure of completing them all simply wasn't a big draw.In summary, a really fun game for driving game lovers looking for a little action on the PSP, but it's just a rental title. \n",

      "Regardless of what others may say, I find EAD's &quot;Luigi's Mansion&quot; a great game for anyone. It really is a shame that people may bypass it due to its graphics (remember to never judge a book by its cover).The premise is simple. Mario's younger and less famous brother Luigi won a mansion in a contest he never entered. Sound suspicious? Things get even more mysterious when Luigi arrives at the mansion. According to long time friend Toad, Mario came to the mansion to surprise Luigi, but has since disappeared. Digging deeper into the mansion, Luigi realizes the mansion is haunted with ghosts, and they are going after him. Luckily, Dr. E. Gadd arrives in time to suck the ghost up with his Poltergust 3000 vacuum. After a trip back to his lab, and a little training session, Luigi re-enters the mansion to find Mario and solve the mystery of his mansion.The gameplay is classic Nintendo. Very simple to pick up and play, but deep enough to avoid being called &quot;simple&quot;. The main premise of the game is to capture the ghosts. Players do this by shining the flashlight onto their exposed hearts and then suck them up with the vacuum. There are normal ghosts, which are scattered throughout the mansion (and are not that hard to capture). Harder ghosts are known as portrait ghosts. Players need to solve a puzzle to find a way to expose their hearts and capture them. Some of puzzles are difficult, so have your brain prepared. Even harder ghosts are the bosses. They usually require players to figure out their weakness and then use action-based gameplay to capture them. The controls take some time to get used to, but players should find themselves comfortable by the first boss. The use of the vacuum makes exploring the mansion fun. Around every corner is a hidden treat. Using the vacuum, players can do everything from rattling vases to shake money and hearts out of them, to sucking up table cloths and towels. Also, if your lost or confused, the handy Game Boy Horror will help players learn about their surroundings and direct them to the next areas. The basic way to lose is to be attacked by ghosts. They can hit you, throw bombs at you, or hope you slip on one of their banana peels. Once you're out of hearts, you will start from your last save.The graphics are cartoony. Some gamers would turn away at first sight, but the graphics really fit the game well. This isn't the type of game that would have blood, guts, and profanity anyway. Though the game is not a texture paradise, it carries a lot of impressive effects. From the transparent ghosts, to the lighting caused by Luigi's flashlight, this game is a treat to look at.The music composes of one major song. Luckily, it is a good one. The basic tune will change many times over the course of the game, and even Luigi will hum along. The sound effects are simple, but impressive. The best sound effect comes from Luigi himself as he calls out for Mario throughout the game. As his hearts decrease, the desperation in his voice increases. It is a simple Nintendo touch that will always put a smile on your face.Overall, Luigi's Mansion is a great game. It is incredibly addictive, as I found myself heading back to game often to find out what is hidden within the next room. It may not be the flagship, \"Mario 64\" Gamecube owners were looking for (that is coming next year), it is a great start. I would recommend that gamers look past the graphics and the seemingly repetitive nature (which, once you play, won't seem all that repetitive), and at least give it a trial run. In the end, the gameplay is what really matters, and when it comes down to the bottom line, Luigi's Mansion is a blast to play. \n",

      "Couldn't live without a Cruise Control in my 1997 Toyota Corolla which I just bought! Rostra offered left and right column mount controls as well as dash mount units. I would definitely suggest the column mount. I picked the right side mounted unit as I only had the windshield washer stalk on that side. Left side already had the stalks for the lights and wheel tilt and I thought it might be a little crowded. Turns out after installing it that it easily would have fit on the left (different part number). Depending on your preference or experience with other vehicles, either side would have worked fine. Dropping off the bottom of the steering column was easy on my vehicle and then it was simple to drill the hole to mount it through. You will want to be certain that you check for clearance on the column itself for the stub of the stalk and the wiring. You will also want to be sure that if your other column mounted items move, that they don't move into the location of the new cruise control switch. Otherwise, after finding a good location for installing it and then the hook-up to the actual cruise control unit was a breeze with just a simple pig tail to plug in. The &#34;touch&#34; to set the controls on this control switch is very &#34;soft.&#34; I sometimes brush by it when tuning the radio and disengage it. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 star is because this comes with a green LED light on it and it is so pale that during daylight hours it is next to impossible to tell if it is on or not. This really should be improved. I spend time looking away from the road and attempting to shield around the light to see if it is indeed on or not. There's no good reason for this to not be a more readily visible light. It shows fine after it is rather dark. After about 2000 miles of mixed driving I'm happy with the unit. \n",

The paint being reviewed here is the \"Gloss\" celery.  These two cans I used were used to repaint some old wicker chairs and two metal lawn chairs.  The wicker was no problem what so ever.  The paint went on smooth and evenly and was not overly thick or too thin.  The metal chairs of course needed quite a bit of prep work but it paid off and this paint did the job I pain for it to do.One can of this stuff will go a long, long way and two cans were more than adequate to finish the job.I have used Krylon before on outdoor and indeed, indoor projects.  It is very durable, goes on smooth and I have no complaints.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks \n",

      "Well made with fit and function as expected. Curved lens are close to my eyes, so if that bugs you, you might want to check out another style. Once moving the vents allow just enough air flow to prevent fogging but without tearing me up. I need prescription lens and my local place admitted they couldn't do it for what Bobster charges (~ $90). I sent them in to SoCa and the fun began. Bobster customer service is an answering machine. It takes at least three calls and/or e-mails to get a reply. Sometimes they call, sometimes an e-mail. Maybe.After several hoops and delays on their end, they were &#34;rushed&#34; ordered to their eye guys. After two months, I got them back the same day I receive a message telling me to mail them back because they had switched mine with another customer's. Back they go the next day and then they e-mail me stating their was no mix up just keep them. Little late, Bobster.Last weekend was cold and windy for our Toys for Tots ride and they functioned very well. Comfortable even with the strap under the helmet; no fogging even with a face mask on. I would buy them again and recommend them to a friend.Good product, but poor to confusing customer service at Bobster. \n",

      "My title says it all. After having read reviews i was totally hyped up about it, but after receiving it and using it for the first time it stopped working on me. The power would shut off after turning it on for 15-30 sec. When i called customer service from Hoover they told me it's a built in manufacturer default if your bag is full, but my question is \"How can it be full after first use?\" dumbfounded? I know, i was too. Then after 30 min on the phone with rep they said to drop it off at Sears (Hoover's service center). So here's where the story gets even better... After dropping it off i was told it would take 4-6wks. And i was ok with that. Then 6 wks. goes by so the logical thing i thought was to call Hoover, i left 2 or 3 messages... and i hear nothing back regarding the status of my vacuum still. Finally, Sears calls me to bill me $400 some ridiculous amount for the service repair (which i was told was under warranty for the manufacturer repair). Ummm, hello?!!! I shouldn't have to spend over $200 for my new vacuum and it have a defect after first use AND pay $400 for the repair!! Anyone with me here on this? I could buy 2 more sets of hoover's defective 'Platinum' vacuum at that price!!!! And have a 50/50 chance that one isn't going to quit on me after first use! So once again, i have to call hoover rep back (again having to leave a message) and i finally get a call back 8 wks into this whole drama from a hoover rep and now i'm told it will be another 2-3 wks before it gets done. \"Seriously?\" Let's think through this logically after knowing this whole scenario: if its defective after first use, they should have just sent me a new one!1) i paid for a new vacuum, and had i known the customer service was going to be like this and the vacuum that had such great reviews was going to break after first use, i would have been better off buying a REFURBISHED vacuum (which is pretty much what i ended up with)2) it obviously cost money (apparently over $400) for repairs, so why not just replace mine?!!!3) if they would have replaced mine, it probably would have been expedited a lot faster than the 9 wks i had to wait for my vacuum to be repairedSo in conclusion, shouldn't hoover have thought \"Hmmm, let's keep our customer happy and just replace the vacuum?\"Yeah, you would think. If i could, i would give this product and the poor hoover customer service a big fat ZERO on review. \n",

The whole set looks adorable and everything else works great, but this lunchbox has many drawbacks. Its size and shape make it hard to accommodate things inside, and even harder for a kid to fit everything back in. The top compartment's round shape really restricts what you can put inside and the bottom compartment is not deep enough to compensate. The back mesh holder cannot hold the matching bottle, it just slips out and fall. Front design started to peel off after 2 weeks. I do love the backpack and the bottle, so I regret having chosen this lunchbox over the more square-shaped one. \n",

      "This is a very poorly designed garlic press.  First, the hopper is quite small so if you have large cloves you must cut them smaller first.  Second, I haven't had any luck with it working well with unpeeled cloves.  So I've had to peel all of the cloves before I use it.  Third, this thing is TERRIBLE to clean.  Since the hopper is so small the garlic skins are so hard to get out.  I usually spend more time cleaning the press than I do using it.  And fourth, the actual press is on a hinge so it is difficult to make sure you have it at just the right angle to actually work.  If it's off enough it will just get caught on the sides of the hopper.  Overall, you would be better with pretty much any garlic press out there. \n",

I used it in an office for ~6 months and have tried all 4 of Illy's varieties (medium, dark, lungo, and decaf).Coffee from this machine is incredibly consistent and incredibly boring.  It'll never be too bitter or sour, but it will also never be memorable like a good espresso.  It's like the Folger's or Maxwell House of the espresso world: best for those whose only desire is to dose caffeine into their system in 1-2 oz increments.Anyone passionate about coffee will likely tire of this machine rapidly as options for roasts are limited and none are nearly as good or complex as what can be produced from a standard espresso machine.  If you're looking for good espresso on a budget, I'd suggest taking a look at a Mypressi Twist and Zassenhaus hand grinder. \n",

      "I got a Neato XV-11 just over a year ago and loved it at first.  It really kept the floors clean.  Then, at just over 1 year old, it has gone completely dead.  I wasted my time calling customer service.  They wouldn't fix it because it was over 1 year old.  Their tech person said the problem was because the batteries went dead and tried to sell me a new set of batteries for $80.  I thought that was non-sense and checked the batteries myself with a volt meter.  No problems there, 7.4V.  Then I jumped the batteries to my cordless drill and they worked just fine.  Since it was out of warranty and Neato was offering nothing, I decided to open it up and look for the problem.  It took a while to get apart, but inside I found the main circuit board had a burned spot.  My assumption is that an electronics component went ban and started drawing too much current until it overheated and burned a spot.  I couldn't fix it and now its trash.  I'm not throwing good money after bad to fix it.  Don't waste YOUR money. \n",

      "I've been using this food processor for 6 months or so. The \"processing\" part of it works fine but the feed tube is a complete failure. The machine won't work unless the \"pusher\" is locked into place. The \"pusher\" itself is actually a telescoping part: an outer tube slides over the feed tube and locks (awkwardly) into place. The \"pusher\" can then be operated. In order to use the tube, the entire part has to be removed (awkward), a piece of say, cheese, can be dropped in for grating, then the part has to be reattached. The outer tube locks in, the cheese forces the \"pusher\" into the up position, and then you can grate/chop. You can't just lift out the \"pusher\" and add more cheese. It's beyond cumbersome - and the \"pusher\" part doesn't come apart for easy cleaning.  The food processor isn't saving me time in the kitchen, and I find that I use it infrequently because it's such a pain. Seriously wish I'd chosen another machine. \n",

      "It took me a few days to decide whether or not I really wanted to buy the Nutri Bullet. I eventually did and I have no regrets. I have been using it for about one month now. The first nutri blast I made was not good because I used avocado and not enough water. It was way to thick. If you do not want a baby food consistany, then you have to leave enough room for a good amount of water.I read reviews that said their nutri bullet leaked. Mine has not leaked yet. I do make sure that I only fill it to the &#34;max line.&#34;I have followed a few recipes but I find it easier to just add my favorite ingredients. I have been drinking 1-2 a day and I have lost almost five pounds in three or so weeks. I feel great. My digestive system is working much better.The only negative thing that I have found with drinking the nutri blasts is that they are hard on my teeth. There is a lot of acidity in healthy foods so I can tell my teeth have been more sensitive and are probably being stripped of enamel. I brush my teeth after every nutri blast. \n",

Every surface had a film of dirt on it.  I had a friend who had one of these and I thought I would order and give a try.  Once I plugged them in and ran them on high for a couple of days there was a noticeable difference in the amount of airborne dust in the trailer.  my nose thanked me every day for getting these.  during the day I would put them on low and you could hardly notice they were even there.  At night I would turn them up to hi for more air changes.  It is hard not to notice them when they are on hi so I would not recommend leaving them on that setting all the time.  When it came time to clean them I just took out the filter and knocked them clean outside and put them right back in.Since then they have come home with me and run 24/7 in my living room and I have noticed that the dust in the house has gone down tremendously. \n",

      "We already had an inexpensive Cobbler shaker (the 3-piece type with a lid that has a built-in strainer), but it had formed a tiny stress fracture near the lip and was leaking every time I used it. Unfortunately, every shaker of this type that I could find on Amazon had several reviews mentioning a bad seal. I'm sure many of these were user error, but it's hard to tell which ones. Since I didn't want to take a chance, I decided to try a Boston shaker instead.  Added bonus: not having to try to pry that stupid lid off the shaker every time I use it (oh, and the strainer on ours was TERRIBLE, straining 80% into the glass and 20% everywhere BUT the glass).Anyway.  I love this one. It's simple and effective, pairing nicely with the pint glasses already in my kitchen. It creates a good seal and the glass separates easily when done. I bought it with anOXO Steel Hawthorne Strainer, and while the spring on the strainer is too small for a tight fit (it's perfect on the pint glass, but too small on the shaker) it still works fine held in place with a finger.No complaints all the way around. If you're trying to decide between a Boston shaker and a Cobbler, definitely get a Boston. And get this one because it works, and it's practically free. \n",

      "After much ado,I have finally settled on a toaster oven - this digital 6-slice Oster toaster oven; and must say I am very happy with my decision.Finding a good convection toaster oven was a small ordeal. I did not want to spend a lot of money, but I wanted quality and convection. (Unresalistic? Perhaps.) I went through the purchase and return of 3 other toaster ovens after deliberating online/in Lowe's, Sears, Dillards, Target, Macy's, and Amazon.com.So here's the story: Our 10-yr-old toaster oven (a general run-of-the-mill oven) needed to be replaced (still worked, but was hurtin').  So I went out and made a snap decision on the EmersonWest Bend 74706 Countertop Oven with Rotisserie Attachmentwhich had a rotisserie feature and happened to be on clearance (bonus); so I bought it for $50-.  When I unpacked it to the counter, I found out you have to preheat the oven 2 mins before you toast your bread.  I primarily want to toast, this wasn't going to cut it for me; although I toasted well, and if you primarily want to cook/bake, it may be a good solution for you.  For me, it went back.I then bought the Black & Decker toaster oven[[ASIN:B001GJSMKE Black & Decker CTO4500S 6-Slice CounterTop Convection Oven with Pizza Bump, Stainless Steel]. Unpacked it to the counter, and my initial impression is that it looked cheap (the black, white, or red versions may not look as cheap as the stainless-steel look).  Then I made some toast - it only toasted the top side.  Back it went.I then bought the DeLonghi[[ASIN:B000TDTF22 DeLonghi RO2058 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven with Rotisserie]] on sale.  Got it home, and it toasted great, but it was slightly complicated and cooked poorly.  I had popped in some Sister Schubert's rolls to bake(using the no time to thaw method); using first the baking method, then the convection method, my rolls were still frozen, despite a heated oven.  So, back it went.Needless to say, I was getting a little frustratd with this whole deal, and started thinking that maybe I should just go for the Calphalon (although upon review, it recieved poor reviews) or the Cuisinart (but the interior was too small for me).  I searched on-line again and read the Oster reviews which sounded promising (high-quantity of reviews with relatively high star rating).  So I bought it; it's on the counter.  The toast does indeed get a St. Tropez tan, frozen rolls heat up quickly with the convection oven, and it looks good - not cheap.  This one is just right. \n",
